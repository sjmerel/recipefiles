Whole Grain Mustard Sauce

1.       Render the bacon until crisp. Place the bacon and water in a thick bottomed saucepot over a medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Continue simmering as the bacon releases its fat and the water boils off. Stir frequently as the bacon begins to brown. When it is crisp carefully pour off half of the fat and add the onion immediately.

2.       Brown the onions for a few minutes until they are fully aromatized and begin to caramelize. Add the garlic and stir for a few minutes longer until it is heated through and you can smell it.

3.       Add the broth and mustard. Bring the mixture to a simmer and continue cooking until the onions are soft and the liquid reduces by a third.

4.       Puree the sauce until smooth in a high speed blender. Reserve for later use.

5.       When ready to serve, return the sauce to a sauce pot and heat it through. </p></body></html>
