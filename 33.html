Pork filets. If they are sort of large slice them in half. 
Salt to taste 
Juice from 2 oranges 
1 garlic clove 
1 ancho chile (remove stem and slice with kitchen scissors into strips) 
1 tblsp (a little less is fine) of lard, yes lard* 

Sprinkle the filets with salt and brown them anyway you’d like. Remove from pan. Melt lard and brown sliced ancho chile until crisped. Put orange juice, garlic clove, and ancho in blender and liquefy. Return pork to pan and cover with salsa. Simmer covered over low heat for a good while until the pork is tender. Slice and serve with tortillas for tacos or leave whole and serve as a main meat dish. 

*I suppose that you could use oil (olive? corn?) but honestly, things taste better with lard and in a pork dish, a teensy bit of lard is really the least of your worries. </p></body></html>
