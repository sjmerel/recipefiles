A simple-to-make crowd pleaser, wonderful at the Holidays, and good if you're looking for a substantial dish for vegetarians</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 c. cream
1 t. chipotle puree, or 1-2 chipotle chilis ground or reconstituted and finely minced (without seeds)
1 1/2 lbs. peeled sweet potatoes, sliced thinly (1/16th in.) with a mandoline
Kosher salt
Black pepper

1. Preheat oven to 375?. In a bowl, whisk together the cream and pur√©e until smooth.

2. In an 8 1/2"x4 1/2" terrine or bread pan that is 2 3/4" deep, arrange a thin layer of yams. Season with a little salt and pepper and spoon over a little of the cream mixture. Repeat layering the remaining yams and cream mixture, seasoning every other layer. Press firmly on the gratin to compact the yams.
