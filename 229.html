Also, it's a good way to use up those cans of pumpkin which are sitting in the back of your cupboard.  It's adapted from the Joy of Cooking pumpkin pie recipe, but with less sugar and no cream.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Ingredients:
 2 large eggs
 2 cups (1 15 ounce can) pumpkin puree
 1 1/2 cups (a small can) evaporated milk
 1/4 cup molasses
 sugar to taste
 1 tsp cinnamon
 1 tsp ground ginger
 1/2 tsp nutmeg
 1/4 tsp ground cloves or allspice
 1/2 tsp salt

Preheat oven to 375.  Whisk eggs in a pyrex baking dish, then whisk in the rest of the ingredients.  Cook in a water bath until it's set but still a little wobbly (usually about 45 minutes).  </p></body></html>
