Her description of making it with her niece and pix were mouthwatering. I have to confess that used cream in the sauce as the recipe indicates, but am considering trying to make it with whole milk to make it a little less heavy. It is delicious with basmati rice, a simple side vegetable, and very cold Kingfisher. Just like in a restaurant!  </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">    *   1 cup yogurt
    * 1 tablespoon lemon juice
    * 2 teaspoons ground cumin
    * 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
    * 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
    * 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
    * 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
    * 1 teaspoons salt, or to taste
    * 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces
    * 4 long skewers
    * 1 tablespoon butter
    * 1 clove garlic, minced
    * 1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
    * 2 teaspoons ground cumin
    * 2 teaspoons paprika
    * 3/4 teaspoons salt, or to taste
    * 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
    * 1 cup heavy cream
    * 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

In a large-ish tupperware container, combine yogurt, lemon juice, 2 teaspoons cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, black pepper, ginger, and 1 teaspoons salt. Stir in chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Preheat a grill so that it's very hot or turn the broiler on high. (that's what those of us without a grill do). 
 Lightly oil the grill grate. Thread chicken onto skewers, and discard marinade. Grill until juices run clear, about 5 minutes on each side.
Melt butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic and jalapeno for 1 minute. Season with 2 teaspoons cumin, paprika, and 3/4 tsp salt. Stir in tomato sauce and cream. Simmer on low heat until sauce thickens, about 20 minutes. Add grilled chicken, and simmer for 10 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, and garnish with fresh cilantro.
