We've also made it with plums, but lots of other fruits would work as well.  We've also used brown sugar instead of white.
</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2 tsp plus 1/3 cup sugar, divided
3/4 pound cherries, pitted (about 2 cups)
3 eggs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups 1% milk
1 Tbsp confectioner's sugar

Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a 10-inch pie plate and sprinkle with 2 tsp sugar.  Arrange cherries in bottom of plate. Place eggs, remaining 1/3 cup sugar, flour, vanilla and milk in a blender; blend until smooth.  Pour over cherries.  Bake for 35 minutes, or until golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack until warm.  Sift confectioner's sugar over top before serving.
