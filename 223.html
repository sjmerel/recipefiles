1 lb. smoked sausages
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon soy sauce
2 Tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 Tablespoon mustard (we like spicy deli-style mustard)
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper-OR-Tabasco, to taste
2 Tablespoons tomato paste
1 Tablespoon brown sugar

Mix together the water, soy sauce, Worcestershire, mustard, pepper or Tabasco, tomato paste, and brown sugar.  Set aside.

Heat olive oil in a large skillet, over medium heat.  Cook sausages about 15 minutes, until well browned and cooked through.  Drain fat and return skillet and sausages to medium heat.  Stir in sauce mixture.  Bring contents to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes.</p></body></html>
