Many people have told me that they are the best pancakes they have ever had.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 cup flour
3/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/4 cups buttermilk (*)
1 egg
3 tbsp butter

Mix dry ingredients on one bowl.  Sift if desired.  (Sifted is a little better, but is more work.)  Mix eggs and buttermilk in another bowl.  Melt the butter in the frying pan.  Then pour butter into wet, and stir wet into dry.  Mix.  Then cook immediately.

The pancake is ready to flip when holes pop and stay open.  Flip once, let brown on the other side, then serve.  Resist the temptation to fiddle, that is bad for the texture.

(*) You can make your own buttermilk by mixing lemon juice or vinegar with milk and letting sit a few minutes.  You'll need 1 tbsp of acid per cup of buttermilk.</p></body></html>
