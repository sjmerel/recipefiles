It is so yummy I make it at least once a week for the kids.
It makes a 9x13 pan so it is great for parties as well.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">gather:
2- refrig. chocolate chip cookie dough* room temp
1- 8oz. pkg. cream cheese room temp
1/2-cup sugar
1-egg

then:
~for the crust: take a 9x13 pan and grease the bottom
~lay your first cookie dough on the bottom, spreading it out to fill
~in a mixing bowl beat cream cheese, sugar & egg until smooth
~spread the mixture over the crust, spread the second cookie dough over top
(I find it works best to spread each square out in your hand, then place it on top
it covers more that way rather than crumbling the top layer)
~Bake 350   35-40 Minutes or until done. Cool.  

*I use Buehlers Cookie Dough 18oz. flat in squares.</p></body></html>
