1. Empty chicken cavity of neck, etc. Trim the neck flap and excess fat from around the cavity. Rinse and dry the bird well. Set on a rack on a baking sheet, and let rise to room temperature an hour or two.

2. Slice the onion and get orange juice and about 1tsp zest. Mix cardamon, zest, and onion rings in with juice.
