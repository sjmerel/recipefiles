I 3" Onion, sliced
1 Orange, zest and juice

1.5  Tbsp honey
8 coriander seed pods, lightly crushed
8 cranks of black pepper corns, or 1/4 tsp
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 Tbsp ginger root, shredded, or 1 tsp powdered ginger
1 Tbsp dried lemongrass

Directions

1. Empty duck cavity of neck, etc. Trim the neck flap and excess fat from around the cavity. Rinse and dry the bird well. Set the duck on a rack on a baking sheet, and let rise to room temperature an hour or two.

2. Heat the oven to 300 degrees F. Pierce the duck's skin all over (including the back), every 1/2-inch, with a skewer or small knife. Season the cavity with the strips of the orange zest and the onion. 

3. Set the duck on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast the bird for 3 hours and 15 minutes, removing the duck from the oven every hour to prick the skin again. Turn from breast down to back down.

4. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Combine the honey, coriander, pepper, orange juice, vinegar, ginger, and lemongrass in a small saucepan. Heat, stirring, over medium-high heat until warm. Remove glaze from the heat and set it aside at room temperature while the duck cooks.

5. After 3 hours and 15 minutes remove the duck from the oven and carefully, pour off the excess fat from the pan. Place in breast up position.

6. Raise the oven temperature to 450 degree F. Return the duck to the oven and roast until crisp and brown, about 30 minutes more.

7. Let the duck rest at room temperature for 10 minutes before carving. Brush the duck's skin with glaze 4 to 5 five times during the resting period. Carve the duck and transfer pieces to warm serving platter. Serve the remaining glaze at the table to drizzle over the duck, if desired.
