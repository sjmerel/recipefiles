The most popular fruits to use in my household are cherries or blackberries.  I buy frozen bags then thaw them.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 2/3 cups flour
3 tbsp sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1 1/4 cups milk
1-2 eggs
4 tbsp butter

Mix dry ingredients in one bowl.  Sift if desired.  Mix milk and eggs in another bowl.  Melt the butter in the frying pan.  Pour the butter into the wet, then the wet into the dry while stirring.
