It's a good way to use up that eggplant that's sitting at the bottom of your vegetable drawer, taunting you.  </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 lb eggplant
4 Tbsp vegetable or peanut oil
1/4 tsp salt
3-4 large cloves of garlic, chopped
12 thin slices of fresh ginger
2 Tbsp sherry
1 1/2 - 2 Tbsp hot soybean paste or chili paste
2 Tbsp light soy sauce
4-5 oz vegetable or chicken stock
1 tsp rice vinegar
1 tsp sugar
small bunch of cilantro, chopped
optional - 1/3 cup frozen peas
optional - 8-10 shrimp

Cut the eggplant into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Steam until tender.  

Heat the oil in a pan on high heat.Add the garlic and ginger and stir briefly.  Add the eggplant and stir for a few minutes.  Add the sherry, soy sauce, chili paste, and peas, continuing to stir.  Add the stock and simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes; most of the stock should be absorbed.

If you're using shrimp, add them now and cook until they're ready.  Add the vinegar to counteract the richness, then add the sugar.  Garnish with coriander.</p></body></html>
