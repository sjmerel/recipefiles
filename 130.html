1 teaspoon vegetable oil 
1 large garlic clove, crushed 
8 ounces (2 cups) shelled pecans 
1 1/4-inch-thick slice of round country bread

4 chipotle chilies in adobo, or to taste (available in most large supermarkets) 
7 cups milk 
1 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
6 pecan halves, for garnish. 

1. In a large pot, melt butter in oil over medium heat. Add garlic, pecans and bread. Cook about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and turning garlic and bread once, until garlic is fragrant and bread is golden.

2. Transfer half the pecan mixture, half the tomatoes, half the chilies and 1 1/2 cups milk to a blender. Pur√©e until smooth. Repeat with remaining pecan mixture, tomatoes, chilies and 1 1/2 cups milk.
