* Sounds like a lot of butter but really itâ€™s not. Okay, it is, but Julia Child lived to a ripe old age and she ate lots of butter. This is a great vegetarian main dish. 
** There are two easy ways of roasting poblanos (the big green chiles). One is to put them in a cast iron skillet in the broiler, turning them every so often. You can also roast them over a flame on the burner using a fork to hold and turn them. Once the skins is charred place chiles in a plastic bag for 5-10 minutes. Remove the charred skin and cut out the stem and seeds. Slice into strips.</p></body></html>
