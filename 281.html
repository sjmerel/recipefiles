</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 cup butter
2 cups sugar
1-1/2 tsp baking powder
2 eggs
1 large tsp vanilla
and flour enough to 'roll thin'

In a mixer, cream the butter and the sugar
add the eggs, one at a time 'til incorporated
add the baking powder and the vanilla and 
beat well.

Now, incorporate flour into the mixture until it is
no longer sticky,  ie so that the dough can be
rolled thin...Thin is the name of the game here. These 
are rolled thin and cooked quick...Think 'Crisp'...

Cut the cookies into diamond shapes with a knife; 
a sort of cross-hatch does it. Make them about 2 inches 
on a side. Place the cookie sheet into a 375 oven for 
seven minutes or until the edges are just browned.

(Additonally,  cardamom or ground anise seeds only 
make this basic recipe better!)

Of course, they are a perfect refrigerator cookie; if you 
have a stand mixer,  double the recipe. The dough  can 
be frozen and sliced with a knife....BenB.</p></body></html>
