This delicious recipe is from Bon Appetit in 2000. We've made it for such notable occasions as Rebecca getting her Ph.D. and Francine's 30th birthday. It is good for more regular occasions too! </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Guava-lime glaze:
2 cups canned guava nectar
1 cup orange juice
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1/3 cup fresh lime juice

Combine nectar, orange juice and vinegar in heavy medium saucepan. Boil until reduced to 2/3 cup, about 30 minutes. Cool completely. Mix in lime juice. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.) 

The Rest:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon minced peeled fresh ginger
2 garlic cloves,  minced
1 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper
18 uncooked colossal shrimp or 36 jumbo shrimp (about 2 pounds), peeled,  tails left intact, de-veined
2 red bell peppers, each cut into 12 pieces
2 firm but ripe mangoes,  peeled,  pitted,  each cut into 12 wedges
6 12-inch bamboo skewers (for colossal shrimp) or twelve 12-inch bamboo skewers (for jumbo shrimp),  soaked in water 30 minutes, drained

Mix first 4 ingredients in large bowl. Add shrimp, bell peppers and mangoes; toss to coat. Alternate bell pepper, mango and 3 colossal shrimp on each of 6 skewers, or alternate bell pepper, mango and 3 jumbo shrimp on each of 12 skewers. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)

Grill shrimp until cooked through, brushing with glaze during last 2 minutes, cooking colossal shrimp about 4 minutes per side and jumbo shrimp about 3 minutes per side.</p></body></html>
