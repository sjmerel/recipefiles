The sun's shining.  Come on people, let's get the ice cream ball rolling.  
We've got better recipes than this, but we needed ice cream fast.  Almost no effort, less than an hour and we had something delicious and almost Italian in its consistency.  </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 individual bottle smoothie - Innocent's Blackberry and Blueberry, in the first instance
1 supermarket tub of ready made custard/creme anglaise (1 pint, 500ml)
2 tbsp icing sugar (confectioner's sugar)

Sieve the sugar into the juice, pour in the custard, and mix. 
Pour into ice cream maker and watch, fascinated, for 30 minutes, as the magic happens. 
Eat. 
Freeze the rest.  Whereupon it loses that Italian softness, but hey.
