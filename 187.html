From Elle Mexico, of course. The recipe says stars, but use whatever cookie cutters you have on hand (or make them round). </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">150 g flour (3/4 cup)
100 g butter (3 ozs).
2 tblsp grated parmesan
3 tsp. water
1/2 tsp. salt
2 eggs
1oz. parmesan
1/2 tsp. white sesame seeds
1/2 tsp. black sesame seeds

In a food processor mix the flour, butter, grated parmesan, water, salt, and one egg until you have a dough that doesnâ€™t stick to your fingers. [If you don't have a food processor cut the butter into the flour and salt first then add the other ingredients].

Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least one hour. 
Take the dough out of the fridge one hour before you plan to use it.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the piece of parmesan into small strips using a vegetable peeler. 

Roll out the dough with a rolling pin and cut the cookies with a cutter in the shape of a star. Beat the remaining egg with a fork and with a brush varnish each cookie. Sprinkle the sesame seeds over each cookie and decorate with strips of parmesan. 
	
Place the cookies on a non-stick cookie sheet and bake them for 15 minutes (approx.), or until golden and the parmesan melts.  Remove them form the baking sheet and cool on a wire rack. Eat while warm.
