I first had it in San Giminnano and then found this receipe in the NY Times when I got home. 
I have made it countless times and it is great comfort food on a cold New England day.
Its even better the second day as leftovers.Thise I've served always ask for the receipe.
This is really a mush, and while it doesn't sound or look that great it is wonderful! 
Trust me! 
Also you only dirty up one pot! Really one and 1/2 half as all you have to do is rinse the sause pan.
Hey; this is important!</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 can cannellini beans ( I sometimes add more beans for a heartier receipe)
9-10 slices good quality stale bread (I always use a multi grain )
6 cups vegetable, beef or chicken stock ( I use chicken stock )
5-6 large kale leaves torn into 2 inch pieces. ( I use more )
2 large chopped carrots
2-3 medium potatoes pealed and chopped into half inch cubes
As much garlic as you like. I use 3-4  cloves.
salt if desired
fresh ground pepper
1/2 cup olive oil

Drain beans
Toast bread lightly. It should not be dark brown
cut into pieces no larger than 3" square. 
Bring stock to boil in sauce pan and add the kale, 
reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes,
Add carrots and simmer for another 10 minutes;
Add garlic, potatoes and beans.
Let simmer for another 5 minutes
Salt and pepper to taste.
Preheat oven to 350 
Ladle a layer of soup into a large pot. ( I use my 5 quart cast iron Dutch oven )
Cover with a single layer of toast pieces.
Drizzle with one T of olive oil
repeat with the remaining soup and bread, ending with a layer of soup.
Push bread gently with spoon to make sure its is submerged or at least all wet.
Drizzle the rest of the olive oil.
Cover and bake for 40 minutes. For a firmer textured soup uncover for the last 20 minutes. I like it firmer.
Serve with grated cheese on the side.

Yield: about 6 servings
