</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 jigger  Simple Syrup  (stir to a boil 1 cup water to 2/3 to 1 cup sugar;         depends how sweet you like these)  very quick.  Cool.
1 jigger Triple Sec
2 jiggers Citrus Vodka
juice of 1-1/2 to 2 lemons.

In shaker, add above ingred. with some lemon rinds and ice.
Sugar rim of martini glasses by rubbing rim of glasses with a lemon wedge and turning over onto a plate of sugar.  Sugar will stick to the juice on the rim of the glass.
Pour contents of the shaker into the glass.
Add a piece of lemon if you like.

For a party, you may need to have a pitcher of  lemons all juiced ahead of time. This can be time consuming otherwise. 
And the simple syrup can be made way ahead of time also and stored in the fridge.
