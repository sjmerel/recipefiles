1 tbs turmeric
2-4 tbs butter
1 large onion, diced
2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground mustard
1 bunch chopped cilantro (I have omitted this in the past and it turned out fine)
juice of at least 3 limes
1 large bunch spinach or bag baby spinach, washed and chopped
cooked rice
plain yogurt

Put lentils in a soup pot w/ 2 1/2 quarts water, the turmeric, 1 tbs of the butter and 1 tbs salt.  Bring to a boil then simmer covered, about 20 min or until lentils are soft.  While the lentils are cooking, saute the onion in some butter w/ the cumin and mustard.  When soft, add cilantro.  Add the onion mixture to the soup w/ the juice of 2 limes. Taste and add more lime if you want.  In the original recipe she has you wilt the spinach in butter and add it separately to each bowl--I either wipe the pan that had the onion in it and cook it in there, then dump it in the soup, or I skip that and just add the raw spinach to the soup and cook a little longer.  Serve in soup bowls over a big scoop of hot short grain white rice, w/ a big scoop of plain yogurt on top (preferably not nonfat).  </p></body></html>
