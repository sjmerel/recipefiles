The proportions here are very loosey goosey.  I was using it to stuff a turkey leg, so didn't need much of anything, but if you are using it for a whole turkey, adjust upwards accordingly.

I used this for Turkey, but I bet it would be also super good in stuffed pork loin (nothing like pork with pork!)
