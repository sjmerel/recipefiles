Toss in a bowl with olive oil to lightly coat, then sprinkle with plenty of salt and cumin, if you like it, or black pepper, and toss to coat again. Scatter in a greased baking dish and roast at 375 F, turning every so often, until cooked through---about 20 minutes, although they can stay in longer. Good to do while you bake or roast something else. </p></body></html>
