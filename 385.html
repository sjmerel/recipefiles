Cut tomatoes in small pieces and add about a tsp of sugar. Stir well. Chop basil by rolling up and it will resemble ribbons. Add to the tomatoes. Add about 1/4 cup of olive oil and stir. Add the onions, salt and pepper to taste and lemon juice. Let it sit for an hour or two. Serve on crostini bread that you have toasted and rubbed with a clove of garlic.
