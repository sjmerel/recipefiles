It's worth doing a double-recipe, as it improves after a day in the fridge.  Note that the chorizo he means is the Spanish kind -- the Mexican kind is fairly different, but it would probably work in this recipe too.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">ingredients:
  olive oil
  5 1/2 oz chorizo sausage, finely chopped
  1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
  1 clove of garlic, peeled and finely chopped
  2 sticks of celery, finely chopped
  1 lb fresh spinach, washed and chopped
  8 fresh tomatoes, deseeded and (you guessed it) roughly chopped
  1 14oz can of chickpeas, drained
  5 cups chicken stock
  salt and pepper
  2 oz pata negra, Spanish ham or prosciutto, finely chopped
  2 hard-boiled eggs

Put a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot and add the chorizo.  Allow it to heat up and cook for a couple of minutes until the fat comes out of the chorizo, then add your onion, garlic and celery.  Turn the heat down and cook slowly for 15 minutes with a lid on and without coloring the onions.  Now take the lid off - the smell and color will be fantastic.  Stir it around and get some color happening now.  Add your spinach, tomatoes, chickpeas, and chicken stock.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for around 40 minutes.

At this point you can remove about a third of the mixture and puree it in a food processor.  [I just ran a hand blender in it for a few seconds.]  Pour it back in the pot, give it a good stir and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and stir in the pata negra or ham and 2 or 3 tablespoons of good Spanish extra virgin olive oil.  Divide into bowls and grate some hard-boiled egg on top.</p></body></html>
