It's easy enough that for the last month or so we've been baking a double batch at the beginning of the week and have pretty much stopped buying bread from the supermarket.  The bread tends to be somewhat dense, but... did I mention how easy it is?

I've tried various modifications (different amounts of yeast, adding extra gluten, punching it down during the rise) but none seemed to make much difference.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">3 cups flour (we usually use half whole wheat)
1/2 tsp yeast
1 3/4 tsp salt
1 3/4 cups water
cornmeal for sprinkling

In  big mixing bowl, mix the dry ingredients.  Add the water and stir vigorously until it is well mixed and somewhat smooth.

Spray or wipe a loaf pan with oil, and sprinkle cornmeal in to lightly coat the interior.  Pour the dough into the tin and sprinkle more cornmeal on top.  Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let sit overnight.

In the morning, heat the oven to 350 degrees F and bake until it's lightly browned on top and feels solid when you tap on the top (usually about 30 minutes or a bit more).</p></body></html>
