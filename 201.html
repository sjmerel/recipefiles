BUTTERNUT SOUP WITH CUMIN 
 
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 medium onions, peeled and sliced (3 cups)
3 pounds butternut squash (Or your favorite winter squash) peeled and cut into 2-inch cubes (8 cups)
2 teaspoons salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cumin
3 sprigs of fresh thyme
3 cups chicken broth, vegetable broth, or a commercial broth 
 
In a 6-quart heavy-bottomed soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat and
stir in the onions. Cover, reduce the heat, and braise for 15 minutes,
checking that the onions don't burn.
 
Add the squash to the onions. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, cumin, and
thyme; cover the pot. Braise for another 15 minutes, checking once in a
while that the vegetables do not burn.
 
Add the broth, bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for
30 minutes or until the squash is tender.
 
Pur√©e the soup in a blender or food processor in batches or use an
immersion blender. Reheat the soup; taste for salt, and add more cumin
to taste. 

Serve with a dollop of roasted red pepper puree in the middle. For special effects swirl the puree through the soup with the blade of a knife.
