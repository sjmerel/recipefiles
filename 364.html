It's a Cook's Illustrated recipe.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1 tbsp sugar
1/2 medium red onion, sliced thin
1/2 cup walnuts
1 pound green beans, ends snapped off
2 tsps extra-virgin olive oil
1 tbsp minced fresh tarragon leaves

1. Bring the vinegar, sugar, and 1/4 tsp salt to a boil over high heat in a small saucepan.  Add the onion, return the mixture to a boil, and then immediately remove the pan from the heat.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl to cool.

2. Toast the walnuts until golden and fragrant.  You can use a dry pan, or just put them in a toaster oven for a couple minutes like I do.

3. Bring a pot of water to a boil, and 1 tsp salt.  Add the beans and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.  Drain the beans and transfer to a serving bowl.  Strain the onions from the vinegar and add them to the beans.  (Save the vinegar.  It's slightly sweet and good in salad dressings.)  Add the walnuts, oil, and tarragon, and toss together.  Season with salt and pepper.</p></body></html>
