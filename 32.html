2 handfuls wild rocket (arugula)
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
4 tablespoons creme fraiche
A pinch sea salt
6 slices bresaola (air dried beef fillet)
A piece fresh horseradish, peeled and finely grated
Salt and pepper
Parmesan, shaved
Olive oil 

Remove the leaves from the baby beetroots then boil the beetroot until just soft. Drain, cool and peel. Place the washed wild rocket on a serving plate and sprinkle over any small washed beetroot leaves. Slice any large beetroots into a bowl then add the smaller ones that have been left whole. Add the red wine vinegar, creme fraiche and salt and mix well. Place the beetroots over the rocket and drizzle over the sauce. Drape the bresaola over the salad then grate over the horseradish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and finish with some Parmesan shavings and a drizzle of olive oil.
