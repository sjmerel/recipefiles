In Europe, I've noticed it's treated much more sensibly -- you can purchase  turkey breast slices in the supermarket, for instance.
In Portugal, butcher shops have enormous turkeys hanging year round, which they will cut up and sell as per a customer's request -- anything from a couple of slices of breast to wings or a leg. 

It's now possible to buy breasts or legs in some supermarkets here in Canada. A boned , stuffed leg is probably the most delicious thing you can do with a turkey. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Large turkey leg, with skin intact

Small, sharp knife

Large heavy knife or cleaver

Your choice of stuffing, although something like sauteed zucchini, onion and parmesan cheese goes well with this. 

Cut the knuckle end off the leg. 
Using the small knife, slowly and carefully separate the bone from the flesh, beginning at the thigh end and working down to the end of the leg. 
Keep pushing the flesh down as you cut. 
Try to keep the skin intact.

Once you've done that, you should have an inside-out boned leg. 
Now cut out each of several tendons.

Arrange it so the skin is once again on the outside. 
Stuff it with your favourite stuffing, and truss it up with butcher's twine. 

Sprinkle with salt and pepper. 

Oil and heat a large skillet. Brown the leg nicely, and then put in 375-degree oven for about 45 minutes, or a bit more, depending on size. 

Take it out and let it rest for about 10 minutes. Carve.
