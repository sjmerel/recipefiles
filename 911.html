Ingredients
3/4 cup Safeway SELECTâ„¢ Ginger & Sesame Teriyaki Marinade
3 tbsp. minced fresh ginger
2 tbsp. minced garlic
1 tbsp. O Organicsâ„¢ Granulated Sugar
1/8 tsp. hot chile flakes
2 lbs. boneless, skinless salmon fillet, rinsed, patted dry, and cut into 1 1/2-in. cubes
8 10-in. metal or wooden skewers
2 bunches green onions, white and light green parts only, cut into 1-in. lengths
Instructions
1.In a medium bowl, mix terikyaki marinade, ginger, garlic, sugar, and hot chile flakes. Add salmon and mix gently to coat. Cover and chill 45 minutes. If using wooden skewers, put them in a shallow pan with water to cover and soak at least 20 minutes.
2.Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 in. above the cooking grate only 2 to 3 seconds; visit our Grilling Essential section for complete instructions). While grill heats, drain wooden skewers, then thread cubes of fish onto skewers, alternating with pieces of green onion.
3.Place skewers on well-oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook about 4 minutes. Using a wide spatula and tongs, gently turn each skewer over. Cook just until salmon is browned on the outside and no longer translucent in the center (cut to test), about 4 minutes longer. Transfer to a platter.
