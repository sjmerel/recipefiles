These are easy to make, are intensely chocolatey and are reminiscent of brownies but very light and somewhat crisp at the same time. Definitely splurge and buy good quality chocolate for these. These are even more amazing with a blob of malted vanilla or malted chocolate ice cream on top. Caramel and espresso ice cream work well and I would imagine raspberry or black raspberry would be delicious as well. 

Warning: Whole batches have been known to disappear in minutes with only two or three people milling around the kitchen.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Chocolate Brownie Cookies
From The Last Course
By Claudia Fleming

1/4 C AP Flour
1/4 Tsp. baking powder
1/8 Tsp. salt
2 large eggs
2/3 C sugar
1/2 TB brewed espresso
1 Tsp. vanilla extract
2 TB unsalted butter
5 oz. best quality 70% bittersweet chocolate
(You can use the crappy stuff and they still come out good but not as good as when you splurge and use Scharffenberger or Vahlrona. There is a noticeable difference.)
2 oz. unsweetened chocolate (You can use the crappy stuff.)
3/4 C. mini semisweet chocolate chips or chopped regular sized chips. Ghiradelli double dark chips are the best.

Preheat oven to 375
Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment or butter them if you don't have parchment

Whisk flour, baking powder and salt together in a small bowl

In an electric beater bowl fitted with a whisk attachment whip eggs until foamy.
Add vanilla, espresso and sugar and beat on high speed until thick for about 15 minutes.

While eggs are beating, melt bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate with the butter in a double boiler, microwave or in a bowl over a pan of water.

Gently fold melted chocolate into thickened egg mixture. Mixture should still be streaky
Fold in flour
Fold in chips

Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls (or use a truffle scoop) onto prepared baking sheets leaving an inch or two between cookies. They don't spread too much.

Bake for 8 or 9 minutes until puffed and slightly cracked.
Cool on a wire rack before removing them from baking sheet.
