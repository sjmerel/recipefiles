She makes them every Christmas and if your even slightly late for dinner you won't get any.
There have been fights over these.
Definitely NOT fast but possibly the best baked beans you'll ever taste.
If you don't have a bean pot, a dutch oven with a tight fitting lid or an enameled cast iron pot with a heavy, tight fitting lid will work. I bet a lidded clay pot would work too.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 package navy beans or any small white bean
1 onion peeled and quartered lengthwise
1 2" X 2" piece of salt pork
1/4 cup white sugar
1 Tablespoon Salt
3 Tablespoons brown sugar
3 Tablespoons Molasses
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1/8 teaspoon black pepper

Rinse and pick over beans and combine with all ingredients in a large bean pot. Cover bean mixture with cold water to the top of the pot. 

Cover the pot and bake at 225 degrees from 4:00 p.m. overnight until 9:00 a.m.the next morning. 

Stir beans once then turn oven up to 450 degrees and cook beans covered at this temperature to steam them up (that means evaporate enough bean liquid so that they are in a thickened sauce) 
You know how beans look.  
Check them every 10-15 minutes until desired thickness is reached.</p></body></html>
