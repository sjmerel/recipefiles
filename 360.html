Eaten with Greek yohurt.  Oh yum.  
Like the similarly delicious rhubarb and orange compote, it's from the Rose Bakery cookbook. 
The recipe also suggests adding a handful blueberries, though I haven't yet felt the urge. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1/2 cup caster sugar
juice of half a lemon
1 vanilla bean, cut open and seeds scattered
12 apricots, halved and stoned

Put sugar in saucepan with 1 cup water, lemon juice and vanillan, bring to simmering point, and stir until sugar dissolves. 
Add apricot halves and poach until they begin to soften (5 to 10 mins, varies from fruit to fruit, so Rose suggests fishing them out as they're done). 
Once the apricots are all cooked and places in a separate bowl, remove the vanilla pod from the syrup, then allow it to reduce by up to half. 
Pour syrup over apricots, and serve warm or cold.
