2 tsp cornstarch
1/2 c chicken broth (or vegetable broth or water if you are a vegetarian)
1 tsp chili paste (the stuff that I think is Vietnamese, it is in a big plastic bottle with a squeeze top, it is delicious on many things so you should get some if you don't already have it)
2 tbs soy sauce
1 tbs sesame oil
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp sugar

2 tbs vegetable oil
3 cloves garlic
about 1 inch square of ginger
3 scallions, mostly the white part

1 lb firm bean curd (the best is the Trader Joe's Extra Firm)

Mix the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl. Set it aside. If you have a mini-cuisinart, you can put the garlic, ginger and scallions in and chop them all together, otherwise chop everything up fine. Heat the oil in a wide pan (you could also use a wok), fry the garlic-ginger-scallions together briefly.  Put in the bean curd, stir and fry until it's hot and a little brown. Turn the heat down, give the sauce a stir and pour it over. Let it simmer to thicken the sauce. Serve over hot rice. 

While we're at it, if you're not used to making rice for asian dishes: Get short-grain white rice--we use the "botan/calrose" kind. In a rice cooker, the proportion is 2 c rice to 3 c water. I think you would need a little more water if you're using a pan. </p></body></html>
