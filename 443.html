1/4 cup butter.
Put butter in the bottom of a 2 to 3 qt. cassarole or decorative pie plate (I think works nicely. )
Melt 1/4 cup butter in the dish in the oven.
While this melts, in blender, mix:
3 Eggs
3/4 cup milk
3/4 cup flour
mix in blender until blended well and when butter is melted, pour the egg and flour mixture on top of the melted butter.
Put back in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes.
This will puff up and lightly brown.  When removed from the oven will collapse back to a custard texture.
For larger servings:
Melt 1/3 cup butter in dish
Blend:
4 eggs
1 cup milk
1 cup flour
Same as above.  Pour into melted butter in dish and back 20 to 25 minutes.

Serve immediately.

Serve with powdered sugar and lemon juice gently sprinkled over the top.
