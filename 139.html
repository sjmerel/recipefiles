You can make the batter and poach the apples ahead of time, to save too much fiddling around at the last minute.

From The Ontario Harvest Cookbook</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 batch buckwheat crepe batter - see recipe

2 tbsp unsalted butter
4 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and thinly sliced
1 cup maple syrup
1 cup mascarpone cheese
1 tsp vanilla


In large nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat.  Add apples, cook for 3 minutes, stirring gently.  Pour in syrup; reduce heat to medium.  Cook, uncovered, 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until apples are tender.

With slotted spoon, remove apples from skillet; set aside and keep warm. Pour syrup into heat-proof pitcher; keep warm.

In small bowl blend mascarpone, vanilla and two tbsp of the warm syrup until fairly smooth.

Heat an 8 inch crepe pan or heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Brush pan with a little oil; pour 1/4 cup crepe batter into pan, tilting pan to spread evenly.  Cook for 1 minute or until lightly browned on underside; turn and cook for 30-60 seconds or until crepe is lightly browned.  Repeat until all batter is cooked.  Stack crepes on heated plate as they cook; keep warm in low oven.

When ready to assemble, spoon about 1 tbsp of mascarpone mixture onto each crepe; top with 4 apple slices.  Roll up crepes; top with remaining apple slices; serve with hot syrup.</p></body></html>
