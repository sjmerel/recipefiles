Yes, they actually are amazing, and very easy -- you just need to be able to plan ahead enough to make the batter the night before.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour [we usually do half whole wheat flour]
1 tsp yeast
1 Tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
2 cups milk
6 Tbsp melted unsalted butter, or canola oil if you want to be healthy
1 large egg
nonstick spray

Combine flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a medium-sized bowl.  Add the milk, and whisk until blended.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let it stand overnight at room temperature.  (If the room is warmer than 70 degrees F, put it in the refrigerator.)

In the morning, preheat the waffle iron and melt the butter.  Beat the egg in a small separate bowl, then beat it into the batter along with the melted butter.  The batter will be quite thin.

Lightly spray the hot waffle iron on both the top and bottom surfaces with nonstick spray, and rub on a little butter.  Add just enough batter to cover the cooking surface -- approximately 2/3 cup for each waffle.


Cook for 2-3 minutes, depending on your waffle iron.  Don't overbake -- you want it crisp and brown but not too dark.  Its OK to peek.

Serve hot with your chosen toppings.</p></body></html>
