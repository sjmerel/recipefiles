It's a pretty forgiving way to cook fish.  You can use haddock, code, red snapper, sole, halibut, etc. in place of tilapia.  The recipe is simple and should work fine without the vegetables and herbs if you just want some steamed fish to drizzle lemon juice over.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2 tbsps EV olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
1 tsp fresh oregano leaves, minced
1/8 tsp red pepper flakes
3 plum tomatoes, cored, seeded, and chopped
2 medium zucchini, sliced 1/4 in thick
4 tilapia filets, about 6 oz each
1/4 cup fresh basil, minced
Salt and pepper

1. Preheat oven to 450.  Combine oil, garlic, oregano, pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp pepper in a medium bowl.  This will be a marinade for the vegetables.  Pour half into a bowl with the tomatoes, and toss the zucchini with the other half.

2. Cut four 12-inch squares of al-u-MIN-i-um foil.  Giggle about British accents.

3. Shingle the sliced zucchini on the center of each square of foil.  Season the fish with salt and pepper and then lay it on top of the zucchini.  Top with the tomatoes and seal the packets tightly.

4. Bake the fish on a baking sheet for 20 minutes or until the flesh flakes apart.  Carefully open the packets and push the contents onto plates with a spatula.  Top with basil.</p></body></html>
