1 lemon 
water 
3 tbsp sugar. 

Make a sugar syrup, warming the water and the sugar until all the crystals have dissolved. 
Once it has cooled, mix with the lemon and blood orange juice. 
Put in a wide plastic carton, and freeze. 
As soon as it's frozen, turn it to slush by dragging a fork across the surface. It turns from a deep red block to a mass of pink froth. 
Keep in the freezer. 



Lemon is also lovely; and so is coffee - you mix lots of espresso with water and a lot of sugar syrup. Can't think how much, but the basic rule is that you make it sweeter than tastes right, as freezing makes things taste less sweet. </p></body></html>
