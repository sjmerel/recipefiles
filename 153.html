Adapted from Seductions of Rice by Canada's own Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 lb green cabbage, shredded
2 tbsp mustard oil (available at Indian grocers)
2 small dried red chilies
1/2 tsp cumin seed
1 bay leaf
2 cloves
1 inch cinnamon stick, broken into several pieces
2 green cardamom pods, smashed
1 cup thinly sliced onion
1 large tomato, coarsely chopped
1 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
3/4 tsp turmeric
2 tbsp ginger, minced
1/2 cup water

Heat oil in large pot over medium-high.  When oil is hot, add chiles, cumin, bay leaf, cloves, cinnamon stick and cardamom. Stir briefly and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, and then add onion. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.

Stir in tomato, salt and sugar.  Cook for 1 minute, then add cabbage, turmeric and ginger.  Stir and turn to coat cabbage, cook for 1 minute. Add water, bring to boil and cook, partially cover and cook for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  The cabbage should be tender and the flavours blended.  Remove lid and cook another 5 minutes to reduce liquid.  Serve.</p></body></html>
