It's also originally from Rick Bayless's "Mexican Kitchen." Makes about 1 1/4 cups. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">3 to 6 (1/4 to 1/2 ounce total) dried chiles chipotles colorados (chiles moritas)
OR 2 to 4 (1/4 to 1/2 ounces total) dried chiles chipotles mecos
OR 3 to 6 canned chiles chipotles en adobo
3 large garlic cloves, unpeeled
8 ounces (5 to 6 medium) tomatillos, husked and rinsed
Salt, about 1/2 teaspoon
Sugar, about 1/4 teaspoon

1. Toasting and roasting
Set and ungreased griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat. If using dried chiles, break off their stems. Toast the chiles a few at a time: lay them on the hot surface, press flat for a few seconds with a metal spatula (they'll crackle faintly and release their smoky aroma), then flip and press down the toast the other side. Transfer the toasted chiles to a bowl, cover with hot water and let rehydrate for 3o minutes, stirring regularly to ensure even soaking. Pour off all the water and discard.
If using canned chilese, simply remove them from the adobo they're packed in.
On a heavy, ungreased skillet or griddle over medium heat (you'll already have it on if you're using dried chiles), roast the unpeeled garlic, turning occasionally, until blacked in spots and soft, about 15 minutes. Cool, slip off the papery skins, then roughly chop.
Lay the tomatillos on a baking sheet and place about 4 inches below a very hot broiler. When the tomatillos blister, blacken and soften on one side, about 5 minutes, turn them over and roast on the other side. Cool completely on the baking sheet.

2. The salsa 
Scrape the tomatillos and juices into a food processor or blender and add the garlic. Pulse until everything is coasrsely pureed. Chip the rehydrated or canned chilese into tiny bits, then stir them in. 
Transfer to a serving bown and stir in enough water, usually 3 to 4 tablespoons, to give the salsa and easily spoonable consistency. Taste and season with salt, plus a little sugar to soften the tangy edge.</p></body></html>
