It is quite easy, and dare I say, healthy by Chanukah standards.

From Gil Marks' "Olive Trees and Honey".</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 head cauliflower, chopped into florets
1 onion, minced
1/3 cup parsley, chopped fine
1 cup bread crumbs
3 eggs, beaten
3/4 tsp
Ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese

Steam cauliflower and onion for 10 minutes.  Combine with parsley, bread crumbs, eggs, salt, pepper and parmesan.  Form into oval patties, 2 by 3 inches, tapered at the ends.  Fry in vegetable oil (I used vegetable spray) at high heat on a large frying pan or griddle, 3 minutes per side.  Keep warm in oven until all fritters are cooked. 

Serve with tomato sauce and parmesan cheese, or yogurt.</p></body></html>
