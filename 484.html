If they will do double-duty as lunch for Max too, so much the better. This recipe from Nigella's _Forever Summer_ fits the bill and I've made it quite a few times recently. It actually doesn't seem at all summery to me at all; instead, it's the perfect fall-back year-round salad since carrots and peanuts are dependably available year round, and both keep well. So this is the kind of salad you can make when you don't feel like you have enough ingredients in your fridge to make a salad.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">
4 medium carrots, peeled
1/3 cup salted peanuts
2 tablespoons rice vinegar or red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons peanut or canola oil
few drops sesame oil

Nigella says to grate or cut the carrots into sticks, but I slice them into disks because it's easier. Combine them with the peanuts and then add the remaining ingredients. Stir and taste; you may want to add extra vinegar, sesame oil, or salt. This keeps well in the fridge.</p></body></html>
