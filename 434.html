Great in crock pot
Really good at potlucks and family b.b.q's.
I usually double this, as I am always making them for a crowd.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">16 oz. can pork & beans (do not drain)
16 oz. can small green lima beans (drained, save the liquid)
16 oz. can dark red kidney beans (drained, save the liquid)
1 lb. lean hamburger
1/4 lb. bacon  (I use a whole pound) cut or break into chunks)
1/2 cup onions (chopped)
1/2 cup ketchup
2 T. vineager
1 cup brown sugar, packed
1 T. prepared mustard

While beans are draining, brown hamburger and onions.  Drain.  Brown bacon seperately, drain and add to hamburger, onion mixture.
Add ketchup, vineager, mustard, and brown sugar.
Add the beans, mix these all together and heat thru.  
Add some of the liquid from the beans back into if you want them juicier, but if in a crockpot they will be plenty juicy enough.
