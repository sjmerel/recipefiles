It goes well on roasted asparagus, in a fennel and tomato salad, or on fish.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">ingredients:
  kosher salt
  3 lemons
  olive oil
  a glass jar

Wash 2 of the lemons well; cut off the pithy ends and then slice them thinly, picking out the seeds as you go.  Layer them in the jar with the salt.  I think I usually use about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of salt for 2 smallish lemons.  (Some recipes call for you to also add spices, such as coriander seed or peppercorns, though I don't usually do that.)  Squeeze about 1/2 cup of juice from the third lemon into the jar.  Don't pack the jar so tightly that the lemons touch the lid, or it might corrode and make your lemons get all rusty and gross.

Leave the jar out at room temperature for about 3 days, giving it a shake every now and then to keep the lemons in contact with the salty liquid.  Then pour in enough olive oil to cover the lemons, give the jar another good shake, and put it in the fridge.  

You can just chop up and use the preserved lemon slices, peel and all.  The liquid should turn into a slightly thick, very salty, lemony goo, which is itself pretty tasty.</p></body></html>
