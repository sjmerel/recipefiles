1 fennel bulb, sliced. 
2 tsp fennel seeds 
1 clove garlic 
4 anchovies 
vermouth 
two tins of sardines (assuming you get the little tins with about 6 sardines in like we do) 
25 g pine nuts 
50 g sultanas 
Juice and zest of a lemon 

Pasta - a shape that goes a little floppy, like farfalle, is best. 

Soak the sultanas in a cup of warm water. 

Put on a pan of salted water for the pasta. 

In a pan, heat some olive oil, and fry the crushed garlic, chopped anchovies and crushed fennel seeds. 

After a minute, once the oil is flavoured, add the fennel, cook on a medium heat for 3-4 mins, then add a couple of jolly slugs of vermouth. Cover the pan and cook gently for 10 minutes. 

(After 5 or so minutes, start cooking your pasta) 

In another pan, toast the pine nuts. Take them out, then toast the bread crumbs. 

Add the pine nuts, the sultanas and their soaking water, the lemon and the sardines to the fennel. Cook, still covered,  for another 5 minutes. 

Mix with the pasta, topped with the toasted breadcrumbs. </p></body></html>
