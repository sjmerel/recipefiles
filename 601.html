To her surprise this recipe wasn't on here (it's from Nigella Express it turns out) - but having just eaten it, it's clear it should be - so now it is...</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Ingredients:

60ml Mirin
50g Light Brown Sugar
60ml Soy Sauce
4 x 125g thick Salmon Fillets
4 x 15ml tbsp Rice Vinegar
1-2 Spring Onions (Scallions), cut into fine strips

Mix the mirin, brown sugar and soy sauce in a bowl big enough to marinate the salmon in. Marinate the salmon in the mixture for 6 minutes - turning after 3 mins.

'Fry' the salmon in a heated, dry saucepan for 2 minutes, then turn it over, add the marinate and cook for another 2 minutes.

Put the salmon on the plates, turn down the heat and then add the rice vinegar to the hot pan.

Pour the glaze over the Salmon and add the spring onion strips.

Serve with rice or noodles.</p></body></html>
