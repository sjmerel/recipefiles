1/4 cup orange juice/pineapple juice
1/4 cup raisins
1 tsp honey
dash of salt


Boil water and pour 1/2 cup over raisins.
Trim ends off carrots and then shred in a food processor.
In a medium bowl, mix carrots and juice and honey. Give some salt here.
When raisins seem plump (as long as you can wait!) mix into carrot mixture.
Chill and serve.</p></body></html>
