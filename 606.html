It's pretty easy; the one unusual ingredient is pomegranate molasses, which you can get at middle eastern markets or through the magic of the internet; the tartness/sweetness offsets the richness of the walnuts very nicely.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">6 chicken thighs (or other assorted parts)
3/4 cup ground walnuts (grind them yourself in the blender)
1 onion
1/4 cup or so pomegranate molasses
some chopped mint, parsley, and spring onion

Chop the onion and sweat over medium heat.  When translucent, add chicken pieces and cook until they change color. Add 1 1/2 cup water, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.

Add walnuts and pomegranate molasses (add the molasses slowly and taste as you go, so you don't overdo it; it should be sweet but not overpoweringly so).  Add salt to taste.

Simmer for a few minutes more until chicken is thoroughly cooked.  Sautee the herbs in oil briefly if you can be bothered, then sprinkle on top.  Serve on rice.

(I bet this could be adapted easily for vegetarians; just hold the chicken and serve over some grilled vegetables.)</p></body></html>
