With pencil lines outside, fold paper into eighths; snip off tip.  Unfold circle; cut along folds to second circle.  Grease both the tube pan and unpencilled side of the paper well.  Fit paper, greased side up, into pan.

4.	Sift 1 ½ cups of flour with spices and baking soda.  Set aside.  Pre-heat oven to 275F.
5.	Combine remaining flour with nuts and fruits.  Toss lightly
6.	Beat butter until light and fluffy.  Gradually beat in white sugar, then brown sugar.

11.	Cool cake on wire rack 30 minutes.  Turn out of pan; gently remove paper.  Let cool completely.
