Every restaurant in Los Angeles serves some form of "Chinese Chicken Salad."  This is typically some romaine, colorful bell pepper, scallions, shredded chicken, fried wontons or sesame seeds, and sometimes some mandarin orange segments.  What really makes it though, is the dressing.  After trying several and making my own modifications, I offer my current favorite.

The way I make it is pretty strong and pungent, and if your name is not Leah Whalen you may want to use the upper range of oil to mellow it out. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1/4 cup  fresh ginger, chopped
  4 tbsp rice wine vinegar
  2 tbsp soy sauce
  1 tsp  sesame oil (the toasted kind)
  2 tbsp maple syrup (or honey)
  1 tbsp dijon mustard
  juice of half a lemon
  1 clove garlic, peeled and chopped
1/4 - 1/2 cup canola or grapeseed oil, to taste
  dash of hot pepper oil or sambal (optional)

1. Throw it all in a blender and mix it up.

2. Taste and adjust amount of oil.</p></body></html>
