7 oz best quality bittersweet chocolate 
1 ½ c. plus 1 tablespoon all purpose flour
1 ¼ tsp ground ginger
¼ tsp ground cloves
¼ tsp ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon cocoa powder
8 tablespoons (I stick) unsalted butter
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
½ c. dark-brown sugar, packed
½ c unsulfured molasses
1 tsp. baking soda
¼ c granulated (white) sugar

Line two baking sheets with parchment. Chop chocolate into 1/4-inch chunks; set aside. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and cocoa.

In a mixer if you have it, but by hand otherwise, beat butter and grated ginger until whitened, about 4 minutes. Add brown sugar; beat until combined. Add molasses; beat until combined.

In a small bowl, dissolve baking soda in 1 1/2 teaspoons boiling water. Beat half of flour mixture into butter mixture. Beat in baking-soda mixture, then remaining half of flour mixture. Mix in chocolate; turn out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Pat dough out to about 1 inch thick; seal with wrap; refrigerate until firm, 2 hours or more.

Heat oven to 325°. Roll dough into 1 1/2- inch balls; place 2 inches apart on baking sheets. Refrigerate 20 minutes. Roll in granulated sugar and press slightly flat. Bake until the surfaces crack slightly, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</p></body></html>
