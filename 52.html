salt and pepper
2 small lemons

    1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
   2. Rinse chicken thoroughly in cold water, inside and out.  Remove all bits of fat hanging loose.  Let sit for 10 minutes on slightly tilted plated to drain water from it.  Pat dry with paper towels.
   3. Season generously with salt and pepper, both inside and out.
   4. Wash lemons in cold water and dry with towel.  Soften by rolling back and forth on counter with your palm.  Puncture lemons in at least 20 places each.
   5. Place both lemons in chicken’s cavity (you may need to slice them in half to get them to fit).  Close opening with toothpicks or trussing needle.  Don’t make it completely airtight because chicken may burst.  Run kitchen string from one leg to another, tying at both knuckle ends.  Leave legs in natural position without pulling tight. 
   6. Put chicken into roasting pan, breast down.  Place in upper third of preheated oven.  After 30 minutes, turn chicken so breast side is up.  Try not to puncture skin.
   7. Cook for another 30-35 minutes, then turn oven up to 400 and cook for another 20 minutes (calculate 20-25 minutes total cooking time for each pound).
   8. Bring to table whole and leave lemons inside until it is carved and opened. </p></body></html>
