Nice with Fennel Salad, or steamed green beans. I made this once with smoked herring, and it was delicious. The whole wheat pasta complements the flavors here particularly well.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 can tuna in oil
2 cloves garlic (at least)
1 cup pitted/mashed kalamata olives
grated parmesan

ground pepper to taste

whole wheat capellini or penne, cooked


Chop the garlic and sauté it in a bit of the tuna oil from the can. Then add the mashed olives and warm them….the add the tuna and break it up gently, till all is garlicky and warmed through. 
Put pasta on plates, about a cup, and generously pile on tuna mixture.  Let people mix and add parm themselves. </p></body></html>
