We did something fun with this one like some of our other salads, we cooked a whole wheat pizza crust plain and put this on top of it when it was out of the oven. it was great. :) It was an idea I got after I ate at California Pizza Kitchen. Great idea. :) Just add to the nutrients for the pizza crust.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 lb chicken breast, cooked, cut up into bitesize pieces, See chicken reciepe
6 cups spinanch leaves
1/2 cup red radishes sliced
1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds

Dressing 
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp sesame oil

In a small bowl whisk together dressing. and put on chicken and let marinate for at the least 15 min but up to a couple hours. 

In a large bowel combine spinach, radishes and sesame seeds

Poor chicken mixture over spinach. The chicken mixture will look like it will have alot of liquid, thats ok use it like a dressing and mix togather. 

This is my son, Mikes Favorite :) he wants his wife to get this recipe and make it for him. He loves this one.
