I can't say I'd recommend more than one round, if you plan on operating any heavy machinery soon thereafter. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Ingredients:

2 1/2 jiggers of brandy (I usually use Spanish brandy, but any kind will do)
1 jigger Cointreau
1/2 jigger Rose's Lime Juice
splash of orange juice

turbinado sugar (or any other coarse sugar)
orange peel

Directions:

Prepare martini glasses: pour a couple of tablespoons of turbinado sugar onto a small saucer. Run a damp cloth or paper towel along the rim of each martini glass, and then dip the wet rim into the turbinado sugar. This will give you a glass that's rimmed with sugar. Place in the freezer to chill while you make the sidecars. (This helps keep the drink cold and gives the glasses a nice frosted look.)

Mix drinks: In a cocktail shaker, mix the following in order: brandy, Cointreau, Rose's Lime Juice, and orange juice. Shake. Pour into chilled glasses and garnish with a twist of orange. 

Yields: 2 drinks</p></body></html>
