You can use white popcorn too but the yellow pops up bigger and fluffier.
1 lunch-bag sized paper bag
 
3/4 Tsp. baking soda

1-1/2 C. granulated sugar
2 Tsp. kosher salt
2 Tb. unsalted butter cut into small chunks
1/2 C. water

3/4 C. lightly salted peanuts or  pecans (optional)
 
Line a 10" x 15" baking sheet with parchment
 

Pop the popcorn
Pour the popcorn kernels into the paper bag
Roll the top of the bag down three or four turns.
Microwave on the popcorn setting or microwave on the high setting for 2 minutes and 30 seconds or until you can count to three between kernel pops. 
There will be a few un-popped kernels and popping time will vary depending on the brand of popcorn and your microwave.
Pour popcorn into a large wide-mouthed bowl or dutch oven, something that will allow you to toss the popcorn with the caramel easily. 
Pick out any unpopped kernels
Add nuts if using.

Make the Caramel
Measure the baking soda into a small dish and keep it near the caramel pot.
 
Pour a 1/2 cup of water in a 4 quart sauce pan or other deep sided pan. 
The baking soda aerates the caramel and the caramel bubbles like crazy when you add it so you need a pot with deep sides.
Gently sprinkle the sugar and salt over the water taking care not to get any sugar on the sides of the pan.
Add the butter
 
Cook caramel over high heat without stirring until the bubbles start to turn a light golden amber color on top and the edges start to turn a golden amber. (The caramel is darker below the bubbles so don't let it get too dark.) At that point turn the heat off and immediately add the baking soda and stir.

Note: This whole proces takes about 8 - 10  minutes. Keep an eye on the pot when the caramel is cooking and keep checking it for color every few minutes. It can overcook in a flash. 
.
 The caramel will bubble up vigorously when you add the soda.
Stir caramel briskly with a heat-proof spatula for a few seconds  to evenly distribute the soda/spice mixture and immediately pour the caramel over the popcorn and nuts if using
Don't bother scraping the pot.
Quickly toss the popcorn, nut and caramel mixture with two heat-proof spatulas until popcorn and nuts are well coated.
Spread popcorn in a flat layer on the parchment lined baking sheet and let it cool for a half hour. Break apart when cool.
