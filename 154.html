Yes, dumplings are stodgy, but it's good stodge.  However, if you really don't like dumplings, you can always just serve the chicken stew with biscuits (see recipe).

The original recipe - from The Best Recipe - called for celery.  I don't like celery, so I use fennel instead.  

Serve with a chardonnay or a good quality rose - like Tavel.  </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Chicken Stew

6-8 bone-in breasts and thighs
1 large onion, cut into large chunks
2 bay leaves
Salt
2 fennel bulbs, with tough outer layers removed, cut into small pieces
4 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
4 tbsp unsalted butter
2 sprigs thyme
2 tbsp white or rose wine
3/4 cup peas
1/4 cup parsley, minced
Salt and pepper

Dumplings

2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tbsp baking powder
3/4 tsp salt
3 tbsp butter
1 cup milk

For the Chicken

1.  Heat large saucepan over medium-high heat.
2. Add chicken and onion; saute until onion softens and chicken loses its raw colour, about 5 minutes.
3. Reduce heat to low, cover and continue to cook until chicken gives up most of its liquid, about 20 minutes.
4. Increase heat to medium-high, add 6 cups hot water, carrots, fennel, thyme, bay leaves, salt and pepper, then bring to simmer.
5. Reduce heat; continue to simmer, partially covered, until chicken parts are just cooked through and carrots and fennel are tender, about 20 minutes longer.
6. Remove bay leaf and thyme.  Strain broth to use for gravy.  Set aside.


For the Dumplings

1. While chicken is simmering, mix dry ingredients in medium bowl.
2. Heat butter and milk to simmer and add to dry ingredients.
3. Mix with a fork until mixture just comes together.
4. Form dough into 2-3 inch rounds; set aside

For the Gravy

1. Heat butter over medium-high heat.  
2. Whisk in flour and cook, stirring constantly, until flour turns golden, 1-2 minutes.  
3. Whisking constantly, gradually add wine, then reserved chicken broth; simmer until gravy thickens slightly, 2-3 minutes. Simmer.


To assemble

1. Lay dumplings on chicken in pot.
2. Cover and simmer until dumplings are cooked through, about 15 minutes.
3. Gently stir in peas and parsley. 
4. Ladle into pasta bowls, pour over gravy and serve.
