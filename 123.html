It's really easy, and we usually have the ingredients around even when we're long overdue to go grocery shopping.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 lb. tagliatelle or penne
2 cups yogurt (preferably Greek yogurt or drained yogurt)
1/2 to 1 cup coarsely grated parmesan cheese
4-6 Tbs extra-virgin olive oil
6 cups coarsely chopped onion

Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and add the onion.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.  

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta,.  Combine the yogurt and 1/2 cup of the cooking water and mix well.  Drain the pasta and toss with the yogurt mixture.

Serve on plates & top with the onions and cheese.

[We sometimes throw in some parsley or other fresh herbs, to add some green.]
