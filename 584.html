Cut provolone slices in half.  Slightly overlappins slices, cover bottom and about 2 1/2 inches up the sides of the 4x8 loaf pan with about half the cheese.  Divide remaining provolone into 3 equal portions; set aside.

Smoothly spread 1/2 the pesto over the provolone in pan bottom.  Overlapping slices, cover pesto wtih 1/3 of remaining provolone.  Sprinkle cheese wtih 1/2 the chopped tomatoes.  Over tomatoes, smoothly spread garlic cream mixture, then sprinkle with remaining tomatoes.  Cover tomatoes with another 1/3 of the cheese.  Spread remaining pesto over the cheese, then lay remaining cheese on the pesto.  Fold cloth over the loaf; press with your hands to compact lightly.
