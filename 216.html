This recipe (based on one from epicurious.com) is supposedly based on a dish served at Nobu, though never having been there, I can't attest to its fidelity to the original.  Black cod can be hard to find, though; Nigella Lawson has a similar recipe in "How to Eat" in which she says that it works well for salmon also.  

The proportions here make an awful lot of sauce, but it kept well in the fridge and went well on tofu.  The sauce is rather sweet, so if you prefer you can reduce the amount of sugar; Nigella's version uses about half the amount.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">For Nobu-style saikyo miso:
   1 cup sake
   1 cup mirin
   2 cups white miso paste
   1 cup sugar

Bring sake and mirin to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat.  Boil 20 seconds to evaporate the alcohol.  Turn heat down to low and add the miso paste, mixing with a wooden spoon.  When the miso has dissolved completely, turn the heat up to high again and add the sugar, stirring constantly to ensure that the bottom of the pane doesn't burn.  Remove from heat once the sugar is fully dissolved.  Cool to room temperature.


For cod:
   4 black cod fillets, about 1/2 pound each
   3 cups Nobu-style saikyo miso

Pat fillets thoroughly dry with paper towels.  Slather with Nobu-style saikyo miso and place in a non-reactive dish or bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap.  Leave to steep in the refrigerator.  (The original recipe said to leave it for 2-3 days, but last time we did it for just a few hours and it was fine.)
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Place fish under the broiler until the surface of the fish starts to brown.  Place in oven for 10-15 minutes; the surface of the fish will begin to crack as the layers separate.</p></body></html>
