It's an excellent way to use up pears that are on the verge of becoming too soft, and it fills the kitchen with the most amazing scent.  If I have any vanilla sugar, I use it here, since it can never be too vanilla-y for me. Nigel says to use the very best ice cream here, and as always, he's right.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">4 large, juicy pears
50 g/ 2 oz caster (white) sugar (vanilla sugar, if you have it)
1 Tblsp lemon juice
A vanilla pod
50 g/ 2 oz melted butter
Good quality vanilla ice cream

Peel and core the pears, and slice them fairly thinly.  Toss them in an ovenproof dish with the sugar, the lemon juice, the vanilla pod, and the butter.  Bake in a preheated 200 C/400 F oven for about 30 minutes, until tender and golden.  (You may want to baste the pears occasionally with their juice during this time, but I've forgotten to and they still were lovely.)

Remove from oven and immediately pour over the cold ice cream in bowls.  Heavenly.</p></body></html>
