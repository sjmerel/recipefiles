I have sometimes been tempted to open another bottle just so I could make this.

To make this vegetarian, just leave out the scallops.  I often make it that way, and it works great.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter
1/4 cup chopped green onions
2/3 cup arborio rice or medium-grain white rice
1 cup dry Champagne
1 14 and 1/2-ounce can (or more) low-salt chicken broth
1/2 pound bay scallops
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

1. Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onions; sauté 1 minute. Add rice; sauté 2 minutes. Add Champagne; simmer until almost all liquid evaporates, stirring often, about 2 minutes.

2. Add 1 can broth; simmer until rice is almost tender, stirring 
often, about 15 minutes.

3. Add scallops; simmer until scallops are cooked through and 
rice is tender but still firm to bite and mixture is creamy, adding more broth if too thick and stirring often, about 5 minutes.

4. Stir in Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper. </p></body></html>
