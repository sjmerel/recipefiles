1 10" Pumpkin


Directions
1. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.

2. Take a pumpkin, cut in half and remove seeds. Seeds can be rinsed, then placed on a baking sheet to dry for a few days before toasting.

3. Place pumpkin on lightly oiled baking sheet, cut sides facing down, and bake until a fork pierces the flesh easily. For a 10" pumpkin this will take about 45 minutes.

4. Remove from oven and let cool a bit. Then, scrape the flesh from the skin. Discard skin.

5. Place flesh in food processor and turn into puree. You may need to add a little water to help it along.

6. Use in a few days, or freeze in 2 cup portions.

7. A 10" pumpkin makes about 8 cups of puree.
