instant couscous

tomato sauce:
  canned tomatoes
  eggs
  an onion
  green olives

harissa:
  coriander seed
  cumin
  a few cloves of garlic
  some dried chilis
  salt
  olive oil


Chop the onion and saute it on medium heat with some olive oil.  When the onion softens and starts to color, slice up some green olives and throw them in.  After a few more minutes, add in the tomatoes.  Let this simmer uncovered while you make the harissa & couscous.

Next the harissa: I tried using some stuff I got in a can from the store, but it just tasted like spicy tomato paste, so I think it's worth making it yourself.  Seed the dried chilis and soak them in warm water for a few minutes; then toss them and all the other ingredients into a blender and whizz them, tasting and adjusting the spices as you go.  I like it to be pretty strong-tasting but not excessively spicy.  You can use some of the soaking water from the chilis to thin the harissa out if you want. At this point I usually add some harissa to the tomato sauce, but you can save it all to put on top if everyone wants to control the level of spiciness.

Meanwhile, make the couscous.  While that's soaking, make a couple of little wells in the tomato sauce and carefully crack a couple of eggs into them.  When the eggs are cooked to your liking, spoon the couscous into bowls, and ladle the sauce and eggs on top.  Spoon some harissa on, and enjoy.

If there's leftover harissa, it will keep for a long time in the fridge.</p></body></html>
