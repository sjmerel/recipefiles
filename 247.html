I love parsnips.  Carrots get all the glory, but parsnips have all the flavor.  This recipe is fast and delicious, and I always wish I had made more.

From Cook's Illustrated Jan/Feb 2005</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 1/2 tbsps butter
1 lb parsnips
3 celery ribs
1/2 cup low-salt chicken or vegetable broth
1 tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1/8 tsp ground black pepper


1. Cut the parsnips into 1/2 inch thick bias-cut pieces, halving the thick upper portions lengthwise first.  Cut the celery into 1/2 inch bias-cut pieces as well.

2. Melt butter in a large non-stick pan.  When foaming subsides, swirl to coat pan.  Add parsnips in an even layer and cook over medium-high heat until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, about 2 minutes more.

3. Add broth, sugar, salt, and pepper.  Cover pan, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 6 minutes.

4. Uncover, increase heat to high, and cook, stirring frequently, until liquid reduces to a glaze, about 1 minute.</p></body></html>
