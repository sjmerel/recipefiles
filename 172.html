The licorice flavor of the fennel is great with steak.

Adapted from Martha Stewart's What to Have for Dinner</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">4 med. fennel bulbs (don't go for the really big ones)
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon sugar
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1/4 cup orange juice
1 cup water
salt and pepper
fresh parsley for garnish

1. Trim tops of fennel bulbs, and cut them in half lengthwise.
2. Melt butter in skillet over medium heat.  Add sugar and stir until it is dissolved.  Add garlic ande cook for 1 minute.  Add fennel, cut side down, and cook until well browned, about 7-8 minutes.  Just don't let the fennel burn.
3. Turn over bulbs, add orange juice and water.  Bring to a simmer, and then reduce heat to low.  Cover pan and cook until fennel is soft and most of liquid has been absorbed, about 30 minutes.  If the pan becomes dry, add a little water.  If liquid is left over at the end of cooking time, continue to cook, uncovered, at medium heat until the liquid evaporates.  Garnish with parsley leaves and serve.</p></body></html>
