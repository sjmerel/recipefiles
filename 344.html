If you don't have an ice-cream maker, just use popsicle molds to make fudgesicles.  You can even use an ice cube tray with toothpicks held in place by wax paper.

The recipe is from "Bittersweet" by Alice Medrich.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">3 cups whole milk
2/3 cup sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 tbsps cornstarch

Whisk 1 cup milk with sugar, cocoa, and cornstarch.

Bring 2 cups of the milk to a simmer over medium heat.

Scrape the cocoa mixture into the hot milk.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and bubbles a little at the edges.  Then, boil gently for 2 minutes longer.

Allow mixture to cool in a bowl.  If you plan to use an ice cream maker, she recommends you chill it overnight in the fridge first, with plastic pressed against the surface to prevent a skin from forming.  If you plan to make fudgesicles, it should work to just pour it into your molds and freeze.</p></body></html>
