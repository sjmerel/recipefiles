Claire says I've only added bacon bits to a well known Roman classic - but I think the Gruyere is also all my own work. It's like eating Dauphinoise Potatoes on a pizza - except the biscuity thin crust means it's not nearly so rich.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Potatoes - 2 medium, sliced finely with a potato peeler
Gruyere cheese - 1 handful
Marscapone - 1 tablespoon
Parmesan - a sprinkling, finely grated
Pancetta - 75g / 3oz, diced
Red Onion - hardly any, sliced
Rosemary -  chopped
Black Pepper - lots
Olive Oil

Pizza dough
Polenta/Cornmeal


Preheat oven to Gas mark 7 - 450Â°.

Fry the pancetta, remove from pan and set aside.

Roll or stretch the pizza dough onto a baking tray or pizza stone that has been sprinkled with polenta.

Spread the Gruyere over the base as an 'underlay' for the thin carpet of fine potato slices that follows. Sprinkle with the Rosemary, then the Pancetta, then a few rings of the Red Onion. Add dollops of Marscapone regularly spaced - then sprinkle with Parmesan, Black Pepper and a drizzle of Olive Oil.

Bake until the base is brown and crisp - usually about 15 minutes.</p></body></html>
