325g/12oz undyed smoked haddock
10fl oz full fat milk
1 oz butter
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 stick celery, finely chopped
1oz plain flour
black pepper
nutmeg
large bunch of watercress, thickest stalks removed, chopped
2 beaten eggs
1oz  gated parmesan


Preheat the oven to 190/375/gas5.  Bake pastry blind for 10 mins, then remove baking beans, prick base with a fork, brush with some of the beaten egg and return to the oven for a further 10 minutes. 

MEANWHILE Put the haddock and milk in a saucepan and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for a further 10 minutes. Remove the fish, allow it to cool for 5 minutes so you don't burn your fingers, then flake into a bowl, Reserve the milk. 

Heat the butter in a saucepan, add the onion and celery and cook gently until softened. Stir in the flour and cook for a couple of minutes, then add the poaching milk and stir until the sauce has thickened. Season with pepper and grated nutmeg.  Remove from heat, add the fish, the watercress and the beaten eggs.  

Pour into the pastry case and sprinkle with grated parmesan. Baake for 25-30 minutes, when the tart will have risen and turned gloriously golden.  
Leave to cool for at least 10 minutes, so it has a chance to regroup, and accompany it with what you will.  Some sort of salad, and new potatoes, if you come to our house.  </p></body></html>
