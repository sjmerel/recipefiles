4 boneless chicken breasts
1 (16oz) bag coleslaw mix
1 ½ c. red seedless grapes, cut in half
1 ½ c. celery, sliced thin
1 c. walnuts
1 c. apples or pears, cubed but unpeeled
1 (12oz) bottle Brianna’s Poppy Seed Dressing

Tony Chachere’s Creole Seasoning
Salt & pepper to taste

Sprinkle the chicken with Tony Chachere’s seasoning and bake or grill. Cool or chill and cut into cubes. 

Place in large mixing bowl and add remaining ingredients if serving immediately. Otherwise, add pears and nuts when you are ready to serve. This will keep the pears from browning and the nuts from getting soggy. 
	
This is a great salad for a light dinner or luncheon. Serve it on a leaf of red cabbage or leaf lettuce with a slice of fresh bakery bread on the side.
