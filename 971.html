Baked Potato Soup

4 medium to large baking potatoes
2/3 C butter
2/3 C flour
7 C milk (give or takeâ€¦add or use less depending on how thick you like your soup)
1-2 pkgs of shredded cheese (I use combination of American, Cheddar and/or Co-Jack)
Cooked bacon pieces
Chopped green onions
Salt, pepper and hot sauce to taste

Wash the potatoes and pierce the skin several times with tip of a sharp knife.  Bake the potatoes in 400 degree oven for about an hour.   The potatoes should have some â€œgiveâ€ to them when you squeeze them.  Let the potatoes cool a bit so you can handle them, then slice them open and scoop the inside out the potato out of the skin in chunks.  

Melt butter in large soup pot.  Whisk in the flour until smooth to make a roux.  When the roux is good & hot through, slowly whisk in the milk.  I add just a few cups of milk at a time and let the soup base start to thicken a little before I put in more milk.  Keep whisking frequently to keep the soup base smooth and prevent lumps/scorching.   Add your cheese to the soup base and whisk that in until smooth.  You may need to add more milk since the cheese tends to thicken the soup base some.   Add bacon, green onions and the baked potato pieces; heat through.  Season to taste and serve.
