2 tbs apple cider vinegar
1 tsp dijon mustard
1 tsp salt
1 clove mashed garlic
fresh herbs--I used fresh dill and dried tarragon but the original recipe calls for 2 tbs each minced chives, parseley and tarragon.
6 tbs olive oil.  

Whisk together everything except the oil, then whisk in the oil.  Next time I might double the vinaigrette, the potatoes could have used a little extra.

Salad:
3/4 lbs haricot verts, trimmed
1 lb baby yukon gold or other small potatoes
1-2 ripe tomatoes, cut into wedges
2-3 hard boiled eggs
as many anchovies as you like (she said a whole 2 oz can, I used the kind from a  jar and just 5 or 6 anchovies)
2 cans good imported tuna in olive oil, drained
2-4 hard boiled eggs
1/2 c. olives or as much as you like, nicoise or kalamata
a few leaves of basil, cut in strips
1-2 tbs capers
(the original recipe called for a head of boston lettuce as well, but I skipped it as it seemed superfluous and I wanted to be able to eat the leftovers the next day without worrying about old lettuce.)

Boil a big pot of water.  Add potatoes and cook until tender.  Near the end, drop in the beans and fish them right out again after about 2 minutes, with a slotted spoon.  Rinse the beans in cold water and wrap them in a towel.  When the potatoes are cooked, drain, peel, slice and toss w/ some vinaigrette.  

Now assemble the salad on a big platter.  If you are using lettuce, dress it and spread it over the platter. Dress the beans and tomatoes separately and pile them on the platter next to each other.  Do the same with the potatoes, which should have been marinating a bit. Make heaps of the tuna, eggs and olives.  Sprinkle the anchovies and basil over it, and drizzle on the rest of the dressing.  A good baquette and butter is pretty much mandatory.   </p></body></html>
