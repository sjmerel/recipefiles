It has a rich, roasted taste and takes almost no effort.  Sometimes I don't even bother to peel the potatoes, and I'd say it's none the worse for it.

This recipe also slims down just fine.  If you are worried about the amount of butter and heavy cream, just use less butter and substitute milk.  It's still good.

Source: The Quick Recipe</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">4 tbsps butter
2 tbsp heavy cream
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
2 large or 3 medium sweet potatoes, peeled, quartered lengthwise, and cut into 1/4 inch thick slices

1. Combine all ingredients in a saucepan.
2. Cover and cook over low heat until the potatoes fall apart when pierced with a fork, about 35 to 35 minutes.
3. Stir them together with a wooden spoon.  You shouldn't need a real potato masher for this.</p></body></html>
