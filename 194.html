You probably think of celery as a pretty boring vegetable, but it makes for a surprisingly good sauce here. (It's also a good way to use up aging celery that's gone all floppy in the fridge.)</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Ingredients:
   3 Tbsp butter
   1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
   1/3 cup finely chopped onion
   1 cup chopped celery stalks
   1 cup chopped celery leaves
   2 cups canned tomatoes, cut up, with their juice
   salt
   black pepper
   1/3 cup Parmesan cheese

Put 2 Tbsps of butter, the olive oil, and the chopped onion in a medium saucepan and turn on the heat to medium.  Cook, stirring from time to time, until the onion becomes colored a pale gold.

Add the celery stalks and leaves and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add the chopped tomatoes with their juice, salt, and liberal grindings of pepper, and turn them over two or three times with the other ingredients.  Lower the heat to low or medium low and cook at a gentle simmer for about 15 or 20 minutes until the fat begins to separate from the sauce.

Cook & drain the pasta and toss it immediately and thoroughly with the sauce, swirling into it the remaining tablespoon of butter and the grated Parmesan.</p></body></html>
