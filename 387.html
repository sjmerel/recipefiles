I make it every Thanksgiving and everyone asks for the recipe. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2 cups of fresh cranberries
1 orange quartered and seeded
1/2 lemon seeded
1 cup sugar
1 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup of Cointreau

In a food chopper, chop the cranberries, orange and lemon. [I squeeze the juice out before and add it later]. Add sugar, chopped pecans and Cointreau. Mix well, cover, and let stand at room temperature for 12 hours, then refrigerate.  Make it ahead of time, the longer it sits, the better it is. </p></body></html>
