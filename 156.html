I make these a lot, because I love almond macaroons and these are easy, quick, and not that bad for you. If you live in the U.S., you can buy almond meal (almonds with the skin still on, that have been ground) from Trader Joe's, which makes the recipe even easier.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Ingredients: 

2 2/3 cups almonds or ground almonds
2 1/4 cups sugar
5 large egg whites

1. If you have whole almonds, grind in a food processor or blender. You will probably need to do this in batches. 
2. Stir the ground almonds and sugar together in a bowl. Stir in the egg whites one by one. Chill the mixture for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.
3. Spray baking sheets with nonstick spray and then dust with flour. If you make the amount above you will need at least two sheets. Emmons says just to flour them, but I have found they stick less if I spray them too.
4. Put ping-pong ball size pieces of dough 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. (They do spread, so if you put them closer they may bleed together.)
5. Bake for approximately 25 minutes or until lightly browned; the baking time is flexible and can vary according to whether you prefer your macaroons soft or crisp on the outside, chewy in the center. Let them cool for five minutes, then remove with a spatula. NOTE: even with the nonstick spray, they can be a little tricky to remove; there’s a knack to it, which Steve has, and I don’t. Store in airtight container. Makes 20 large macaroons.
