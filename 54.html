I've tried them with buttermilk,
powdered buttermilk, clabbered milk, yeast, and other things. This recipe uses
sour cream, and it is the best I've ever made. The recipe is courtesy of Nancy
Suppes who runs the Hichborn Inn in Camden, Maine. I have shamelessly
editorialized it.
</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 egg
1 cup milk
1/4 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoons butter, melted
blueberries

Mix the flour, baking soda, and sugar together in a bowl. (Sift them if you
have the patience for that sort of thing in the morning. I don't.) Vigorously
whisk together the egg, milk, sour cream, and vanilla in a separate bowl. Pour
wet ingredients over dry ingredients and stir to combine. Mix in melted butter.

You don't need to butter the pan when cooking these if you have a good non-stick
one, but what does "need" have to do with it really? Drop the blueberries onto
the pancakes while the first side is cooking. If you can't get local
blueberries, use frozen ones, but rinse the frozen ones thoroughly before using
them to get the ice off. You can use non-fat sour cream and low-fat milk if you
want to and they will still be good. </p></body></html>
