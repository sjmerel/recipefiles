The sauce is quite thick, not like many puttanescas, and I prefer it that way.  My father writes, "Make sure you use TASTY olives" and he's absolutely right, it does make a difference.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2 garlic cloves, minced
2 Tblsp olive oil
8 anchovies, drained and cut into pieces
28-oz can crushed tomatoes
8 stuffed green olives
8 pitted black olives
1 tsp capers
1 tsp dried basil
1/4 tsp dried hot peppers (my father often substitutes part of a fresh Jamaican hot pepper here), or to taste
1 lb spaghetti or spaghettini

Saute the garlic in the oil until soft, then add the anchovies.  When they have broken apart (I usually help them a little here), add the tomatoes and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes.  Chop the olives roughly (or finely, if you want them to disappear into the sauce so as not to alarm olive-phobic eaters) and add to the sauce along with the capers, basil, and hot pepper of your choice.  Simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, during which time the sauce should thicken nicely.

Serve over your choice of pasta.  My father claims this feeds six easily, but I've really found it better for four.</p></body></html>
