You can eat ALL the soup you want whenever you want while eating healthy balanced meals for breakfast and lunch. Eat soup for dinner with added lean meat or have soup along with a light healthy dinner. Have fruit or the soup for snacks. Supposed to help you lose 5 lbs. the first week and then 1-2 lbs. a week after that. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">5 	carrots, peeled and cut into 1 inch slices
