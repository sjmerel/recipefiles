Even if you think you don't like cabbage, give this a try.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

The original version, by Deborah Madison, featured peanut sauce, but I felt it was a bit much.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 cup brown rice
1 lb green cabbage, quartered and cubed
1 package extra firm tofu, cubed

Sauce

1 tbsp rice vinegar
2 tbsp sesame oil
2-4 tbsp soy sauce
1 garlic clove, minced
1 inch knob ginger, minced
Red pepper flakes
Cilantro, minced


To cook rice: place 1 cup in a small saucepan.  Add 2 cups water.  Bring to a boil.  Turn down heat, cover, and simmer until the rice is soft and all the water has been absorbed.

Steam the tofu and cabbage together until cabbage is bright green and tender, 8-10 minutes.

Combine vinegar, oil, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, red pepper and cilantro in small bowl.

Put cooked rice in bowls, cover with cabbage and tofu and pour over sauce.</p></body></html>
