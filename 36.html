</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">"It is not known whether the Italian ladies of the night (the puttane) who gave their name to this racy pasta sauce did so because they were short of time or cash or both.  In any case, puttanesca is both quick and cheap, and we hope it offends no oneâ€™s memory to say so"
