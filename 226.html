Nice for dinner parties because you can make them early and just throw them in the fridge.  Very nice with an after dinner sherry, or maybe even scotch (but I haven't tried that one).</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1/2 cup white sugar
3-4 Tbs. espresso powder, depending on how strong of a coffee flavor you're looking for
3/4 tsp. vanilla extract
4 egg yolks

Preheat oven to 325 degrees
Boil some water.
Heat cream in saucepan over medium heat until it starts to bubble around the edges.
Add sugar, espresso powder, and vanilla. Stir until everything is dissolved.  Remove from heat.
In a bowl, whisk egg yolks.  Slowly add hot cream mixture while whisking constantly so you don't cook the eggs.  Pour everything through mesh sieve into ramekins.  Put ramekins into a baking pan, and pour in boiling water to reach half-way up the sides of the ramekins.  Cover the whole pan with aluminum foil.
Bake until just set: the centers will still be jiggly if you shake the ramekins (30-35 minutes).  
The hardest part about this recipe comes here: remove the ramekins from the boiling hot water and set them on a rack to cool...not easy with huge, clumsy oven mits, but tongs are no more dependable.
Cool them there until you can handle them, cover each one with plastic wrap, and put in the refrigerator where they sould stay for a good two hours until you eat them. Yummy.
