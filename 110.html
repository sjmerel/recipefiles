This is Francine's favorite winter soup. And it's an great way to use up all those leftover parmesan rinds. To quote the magazine: 

"This hearty soup makes delicious use of the flavorful 1/4-inch-thick rinds that remain after wedges of Parmesan have been grated away; they infuse the soup with a nice salty bite as it simmers."
</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil plus additional oil for garnish
1 large onions, finely chopped (about 2 cups) 
1 large carrot, finely chopped (about 1 cup) 
1 large celery stalk, finely chopped (about 2/3 cup) 
3 15-ounce cans cannellini (white kidney beans), drained
6 cups low-salt chicken broth
2 teaspoons minced fresh sage
2 2x2-inch Parmesan cheese rinds
3 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, chopped
Freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery and saut√© until vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Add beans, broth, sage, Parmesan rinds, and prosciutto; simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend and soup thickens slightly, about 40 minutes. Using tongs, remove cheese rinds. 

Puree about 5 cups soup in processor and return to pot. Season with salt and pepper. (Soup can be made 2 days ahead. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated. Rewarm before serving.) 

Ladle soup into bowls and serve, passing grated Parmesan cheese and additional olive oil separately.

Makes 6 to 8 servings.
