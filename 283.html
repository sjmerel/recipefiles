Brandied mincemeat pies with coffee for Christmas Breakfast...........</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">4 pounds of beef , cooked;  shoulder, brisket or 'chuck', chopped fine
1-1/2 pounds of kidney-suet, chopped fine
8 pounds of cooking apples, cored, peeled, and chopped
1 pound of brown sugar
1-1/2 cups of Karo syrup
1/4 lb candied citron
1/4 lb candied lemon peel
1/4 lb candied orange peel
2 pounds seeded Muscats
1 pound dried currants
1 tbsp salt
1 tbsp ginger
1 tbsp clove
1 tbsp cinnamon
1 tbsp allspice
1 tsp nutmeg
1-1/2 quarts of apple cider

Put the whole into a large pot and boil for half an hour.
Cool and then 

Add 1 cup to 1-1/2 cups of brandy.

The mixture is put into a crock to rest for thirty days and then
made into pies as required.

Notes: These delicacies are never served cold....they contain beef fat.
Add 1/2 lb dried cranberries where available. Regular raisins maybe substituted for the seeded Muscats. The meat should be roasted for an hour to bring out its flavor and facilitate the mincing/chopping.....Ground meat is less good; ground raw meat is not a desirable alternative....

White kidney-suet is the solid,  friable, tasteless sort.......Ben B.</p></body></html>
