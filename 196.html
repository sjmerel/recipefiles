But really, it's good with any kind of berry that you find in season; just adjust the sugar amount to compensate for overly tart raspberries, for example.  Will's Uncle David gave the dessert its name, and everyone I've tried it on agrees with him.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Pie shell (please try to make one, or buy the best one that you can; you'll really taste it here, and if it's cardboardy, you'll be sorry)
About 1 lb berries of your choice (or 4 cups, if that makes it easier to visualize)
3/4 to 1 1/2 cups sugar, to taste
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 cup water
1 Tblsp lemon juice
2 Tblsp butter, cut into pieces (optional, but good)
Lots of whipped cream to garnish

Blind-bake the pie shell and allow to cool.

Cut the berries into smallish pieces (if using big ones like strawberries) or leave whole if small.  Put about half of them into a saucepan with the sugar, cornstarch, and water, and cook over medium heat until the berries have broken down and the mixture is thick and glossy.  Stir in the lemon juice, then add the butter if using.  Stir in the remaining fruit, and taste.  If it's sweet enough, stop there, or add more sugar until it tastes right to you.  Pour into the cooled pie shell and chill until set.  Just before serving, coat top of pie with lightly sweetened whipped cream.
