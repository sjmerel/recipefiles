I made it for a friend's birthday and it got rave reviews.  They suggest a chocolate ganache frosting, but I used a "real" butter cream frosting (e.g. lots of egg yolks, candied syrup, and butter, butter, and more butter), which was also a nice complement to the cake's sweetness. Use the best chocolate you can find. 
I think that the Chocolate Ganache frosting that accompanies Sarah Jane's "Perfect Cupcake" recipe would also be quite nice. 

The recipe makes a sizeable cake. Cut the recipe in half and use smaller cake pans or make cupcakes for a smaller crowd . </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 1/2 c. hot brewed coffee
3 c. sugar
2 1/2 c. all-purpose flour (I used cake flour for a lighter consistency)
1 1/2 c. unsweetened cocoa (not dutch process!)
2 tsp. baking soda
3/4 tsp baking powder
1 1/4 tsp salt
3 large eggs
3/4 c. vegetable oil
1 1/2 c. well-shaken buttermilk
3/4 tsp. vanilla

FOR GANACHE:
1 lb. fine quality semisweet chocolate
1 c. heavy cream
2 tblsp. sugar
2 tblsp.light corn syrup
1/2 stick (1/4 c.) unsalted butter

two 10 by 2 inch round cake pans

Preheat oven to 300 and grease pans. Line bottoms with rounds of wax paper. Grease and flour pans (and paper).

Finely chop the chocolate and combine in a bowl with the hot coffee. Let the mixture stand, stirring occassionally until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.

Sift together sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. In antoher large bowl, beat egggs with an electric mixer until thickened slightly and lemon colored (about 5 min. with a hand-held mixer). Slowly add oil, buttermilk, vanilla, and melted chocolate mixture to eggs, beating until well-combined. Add sugar mixture and beat on medium speed until just combined well. Divide batter between pans and bake in the middle of the oven until a toothpick comes out clean (about 1 hour and 10 minutes--if making smaller cakes keep an eye on them).  

Cool layers completely in pans on racks. Run a thin knife around the edges of pans and invert layers onto racks. CAREFULLY remove wax paper and cool completely. You can make the layers a day in advance; wrap them well in plastic wrap and store at room temp. 

Frosting: 
Finely chop chocolate. In a 2 quart saucepan bring cream, sugar, and corn syrup to a boil over low heat, whisking until the sugar is dissolved.  Remove pan from heat and add chocolate, whisking until chocolate is melted. Cut butter into pieces and add to frosting, whisking until smooth.

Transfer frosting to a bowl and cool, stirring occassionally, until spreadable. Different chocolates may require a little trip to the fridge to chill out a bit.  Spread frosting between cake layers and over top and sides. Cake keeps covered and chilled for three days. Let sit out for an hour or so before serving. </p></body></html>
