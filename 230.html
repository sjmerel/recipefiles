For a variation, try adding a little molasses, or your favorite jam, or maybe some whiskey.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Ingredients:
   4 cups cubed stale bread
   2 cups milk
   2-4 eggs (depending on how eggy you like it)
   1/4 cup raisins
   1/4 cup brown sugar
   1/4 tsp salt
   pinch of cinnamon
   pinch of nutmeg

Beat the eggs and milk in a microwaveable dish. Add everything else and let the liquid soak into the bread for a few minutes, turning it over with a spoon occasionally.  Microwave until set (about 5 minutes on high, but it varies), stirring at least once in the middle. </p></body></html>
