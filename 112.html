2 large garlic cloves, sliced
1 large shallot, sliced
1 1/4 cups canned beef broth
1 cup ruby Port
1/4 cup fresh cranberries
2 5- to 6-ounce beef tenderloin steaks (each about 1 inch thick)
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
1/2 cup crumbled Stilton cheese

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in saucepan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and shallot, then 1 cup broth, Port and cranberries. Boil liquid until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 8 minutes. Set sauce aside.

Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Add steaks to skillet; cook to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to plate; cover loosely with foil. Add rosemary to skillet, then sauce and remaining 1/4 cup broth. Boil 1 minute, scraping up browned bits. Season with salt and pepper; spoon sauce over steaks. Top each with cheese.
