scant 1 cup of sugar (2/3 to 3/4 cup)
1/2 tsp salt
1-1/2 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp cardamom
2 tsp baking powder
4 eggs, separated
scant 2 cups of flour
Use some sour milk, milk or water or other
liquid so that the white-of-egg can be easily 
folded into this mixture.

In a stand-mixer,  cream together butter and sugar until 
soft and fluffy.

(Great grandmother Oma didn't have a 'stand-mixer';
what she did have was a will to make great cake. So she
beat it like a demon.....350 strokes by hand)

Add  salt and baking powder 
Add the yolks-of-egg, one at a time, until incorporated.
Add the vanilla (add cardamom for superior white cake) 

Add the flour by spoonfuls and continue beating.
And continue beating and then beat some more....

In another bowl, whip the four eggwhites until foamy and then a
bit more until soft peaks just form....Do not over beat the white-of-egg!

You must now judge the relative consistancy of the batter
with an eye to the difficulty of folding soft eggwhites into 
thick batter. The batter cannot be stiff! (ie you must add  
liquid to the flour-butter-sugar mixture in order to facilitate 
the folding in of the eggwhites.  So mix a little liquid to the batter)

Now, pour the batter into the bowl containing 
the white-of-egg and incorporate the both by hand ---'folding';  
use a rubber-tongue or large spoon made for the purpose....

Scrape the batter into a 10 inch springform pan (or into a 
couple of  'cake-pans') and put onto the middle shelf 
of a moderate (350) oven for 50-65 minutes.

Notes:
A slower oven is better that a hot oven...the springform pan 
is an improvement over the old layer cake pan with its 
resulting 4 crusts...

Cool, cut into layers and then fill with jam, liquours or 
custard, and frost with  whipped cream, buttercream....

Leave out the cardamom if you want to make a chocolate cake...
and: 
Add 3 oz of baking chocolate, melted,
Add 1/4 cup cocoa 
(you might want to adjust the sugar to compensate for the bitter 
chocolate,  maybe not)

For Mocha cake, substitute espresso or strong coffee for the
liquid and add 1/4 cup of cocoa powder to the batter.

Cakes made with whipped cream or custard and 
soaked w/apricot or cherry brandy are much better served 
the next day.... Ben B.
