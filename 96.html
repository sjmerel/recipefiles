(adapted from Nigel Slater.)


basmati rice - 200g, boiled 

sprouted seeds (mung, lentils etc) - 175g 

small, hot red chillies - 2 

mint - 6 bushy sprigs [I think I have also added a good handful of another pungent or peppery herby green--like coriander--cilantro--or watercress]

nam pla (Thai fish sauce) - 2 tbs 

lime juice - 2 tbs [I think I added more]

olive oil - 3 tbs 

2 roast chicken breasts or leftover chicken 

Make the dressing by chopping and seeding the chillies, chopping the mint leaves (and discarding the stem) and mixing in a serving dish or tupperware with the nam pla, lime juice and olive oil. Tear or cut the chicken into strips. Toss them with the dressing then add the cooled rice. Mix gently then check the seasoning. You may need a little salt or more lime or fish sauce. Leave for at least 20 minutes for the flavours to marry.
