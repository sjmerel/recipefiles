Can be served as a main course with a salad on the side, or as a side course to Roast Chicken with Lemons.

From the New Cranks Recipe Book</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Ingredients

Large can of pureed pumpkin
100 g/4 oz all purpose flour
40 g/1 1/2 oz Parmesan cheese, grated
25 g/1 oz watercress, shredded
1 green onion, finely sliced
30 g/1 oz fresh basil, shredded
Salt and pepper

For the sauce

150 ml/6 fl oz olive oil
25 g/1 oz watercress, roughly chopped
25 g/1 oz Parmesan cheese, grated
1 clove garlic, very finely chopped
salt and pepper

Method

Add flour to pumpkin.  Mix until thoroughly incorporated, then add Parmesan, watercress, green onion and basil.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Shape mixture with your fingers - lightly dipped in flour - into elongated pieces the size of walnuts and set aside.

To make the sauce, combine ingredients in a bowl and set aside.

Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil.  Test one gnocchi first to make sure it does not fall apart when cooking.  If it does, add a little more flour.  Drop in the gnocchi and poach for 2 minutes until cooked and no longer floury.

Place drained gnocchi into a large flat bowl.  Pour the sauce all over and serve at once.</p></body></html>
