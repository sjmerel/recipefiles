8 oz. lard (contrary to rumor, this is available in the US; if squeamish use oil)
3.5 ozs. panela or queso fresco
1/2 c. milk
1/2 c. nata (substitute light cream; nata is puddin' skin)
4 roasted poblano chiles
3 roasted poblano chiles cut into strips
3 avocadoes
3 roasted tomatoes
1 onion
1 tablespoon of whatever alcohol you have handy
some lettuce 
some radishes

Blend the four roasted chile, tomatoes and onion in the blender or food processor. Fry in one tablespoon of lard or oil. Once the mixture dries a bit add the milk, nata (or cream), alcohol, and salt. Remove from heat when the mixture thickens. 
Lightly fry the tortillas and dip them in the salsa you just made; fill them with slices of avocado, chees and chopped strips of chiles. Roll or fold and serve hot. 
Adorn plate with lettuce leaves and radish flowers if you are feeling fancy. 

Yummy and not too spicy. </p></body></html>
