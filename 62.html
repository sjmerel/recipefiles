We had a room a good three times the size of my London flat, big fluffy dressing gowns and more than a few butterflies in our stomachs. In the morning, we ate Muesli in bed, served on silver platters, and the recipe was so good Sarah later called the hotel, spoke to the chef and got the recipe. This is it. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 cup               Oatmeal 
1x175 gr.         Individual Fruit Yogurt (rhubarb would be my favourite) 
1/2 cup            Orange Juice 
1                      Lemon juiced 
¼ cup               Raisins 
¼ cup               Honey (optional) 
1                      Apple grated 
1                      Banana sliced 
1/2 cup            Grapes cut in half 
1 cup               Seasonal Berries (raspberries and redcurrants are a fab combination) 
 1/2 cup          Whipped cream (v v optional)
  

Mix the Oatflakes with the Juices ,Yogurt, Raisins and Honey, and keep in fridge overnight. 
The next day, add all the Fruits and mix well. 
If it's the morning of someone's wedding, finish by folding in the whipped Cream. 
Enjoy! 

Makes about 6 servings. </p></body></html>
