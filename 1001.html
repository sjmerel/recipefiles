from Farmer John's Cookbook</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1/4 cup water
1/4 cup sweet sherry
3 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari
2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder (make your own, and doesn't need to be exact mix)
2 1/2 pounds collard greens, stems removed, and discarded, slices crosswise
rice vinegar

1.  Bring the water, sherry, soy sauce or tamari, sugar and five-spice powder to a boil in a large, heavy pot.

2.  Add the collard greens; cover. Reduce to a simmer and cook until very tender, 15-20 mins.  Add more water if necessary to keep mixture from drying out.

3.  Uncover the pot and continue simmering until the mixture no longer resembles a soup, 3-4 mins.  Remove the pot from heat.

4.  Stir in a dash of rice vinegar.  Season to taste with more sugar, soy sauce or rice vinegar.</p></body></html>
