1 tbs oil
1 tbs toasted sesame seeds
chopped cilantro

Sesame marinade: 
3 tbs sesame oil (the original recipe calls for 1 tbs dark, 2 tbs regular)
1/4 c soy sauce.
5 tsp rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbs sugar or to taste
1/2 tsp chili oil (not chili paste this time, but the red oil in a jar w/ the peppers in the bottom)
2 tbs finely chopped scallion
1 1/2 tbs chopped cilantro

Slice and blot the tofu. Mix all the marinade ingredients. Pour some in a wide dish, add the tofu and put the rest of the marinade over it. Marinate about an hour (not too long, I marinated it all night once and it wasn't as good.) When ready to cook, heat the oil (you may need more) in a wide pan, pour off the marinade and set it aside, and fry the tofu. It should get nice and brown and carmelized. Add the marinade, cook until hot and bubbly. </p></body></html>
