The recipe calls for holy basil, which I have a hard time finding. So I use a mixture of thai basil and mint. (Italian basil not a good substitute). Packages of fried tofu triangles (available in asian markets) make this quick to prepare, but of course you can fry pieces of tofu yourself. Suitable for vegetarians, except it really needs the fish sauce to work.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 16 oz. package of fried tofu, cut into medium-sized pieces

3 T. oil
3 large cloves garlic, chopped
4-8 serrano chilis (with seeds), chopped finely
1 small onion sliced
1 small red pepper sliced

2 T. fish sauce
1 T. soy sauce
1 T. (heaping) lime juice
2 t. sugar

1 c. thai basil leaves, whole but separated
1/2 c. chopped mint leaves

In large skillet or wok, heat oil over high heat. When hot, add chilis and garlic. Stir briefly, then add onion and red pepper. Stir-fry til garlic is golden and onion softens. Add tofu and stir to heat through. Add liquid ingredients and sugar and saute a minute or two until thickened into a sauce. Turn off heat and add basil and mint, stirring until wilted.

Serve with steamed rice. </p></body></html>
