This one (nb: adapted liberally from Jack Bishop's "A Year in a Vegetarian Kitchen") more than fits the bill.  Not only does it satisfy all of the above requirements, it looks absolutely gorgeous.   My husband pronounced it "spectacular" and it seemed to agree with the baby as well.

1 can tomatillos
1 clove garlic
Lime, to taste
2 tbsp cilantro
Chili powder (I used chilpotle), to taste

Put ingredients in food processor.  Pulse until all visible garlic chunks are gone.

Tacos

1 tbsp vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 lb mushooms, sliced
Salt and pepper
1 cup cheddar, grated
Whole wheat tortillas (yes, corn tortillas are more "taco-ish" but whole wheat is more nutritious)

Heat oil.  Add garlic.  Cook one minute.  Add mushrooms, salt and pepper.  Cook until dark and fragrant.    Spoon onto one half of tortillas.  Top with cheese.  Fold tortillas over.   Heat in oven until cheese is melted.


Put tacos on plates.  Spoon on salsa.  Serve.
