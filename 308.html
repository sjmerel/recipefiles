1/2 c. sugar
1/2 c. unsulphured molasses
1 large egg
1 1/2 tsp. ground ginger
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground all spice
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
1 1/4 c. unbleached white flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 c. boiling water

Preheat oven to 350. Butter the muffin tins. If you are incredibly lazy like me line them with paper liners.
Cream the butter or oil and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the molasses and egg and beat until smooth.  Add the spices and flour and beat until well blended. In a small bowl, dissolve the baking soda in the boiling water. Add it to the batter and mix until smooth. 

Pour into muffin tins and bake for 20 minutes. Cool for 2 to 3 minutes in the pan and then remove to finish cooling on a rack.  

Excellent with Lemon Cream Frosting
2 tblsp butter at room temp.
2 ozs. cream cheese softened (I'd add just a smidge more)
2/3 cup confectioners sugar 
1/4 tsp. pure lemon extract

Cream the butter and cream cheese with a mixer. Beat in sugar until fluffy. Add the lemon extract and beat until smooth. Frost away. </p></body></html>
