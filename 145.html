From Loire Gastronomique by Hilaire Walden</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 batch "Quickest Puff Pastry" (see recipe)

1 stick unsalted butter, diced
1 cup sugar
6 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and quartered
1 tbsp lemon jice

Melt butter in large skillet
Toss apples with sugar and lemon juice
Cook in butter until apples are tender and butter and sugar is thickened and golden brown
Remove from heat and let cool
On a lightly floured surface, roll out pastry to a round about 1/2 inch larger in diameter than your tart pan.  Prick it with a fork, cover and chill for 30 minutes
Preheat oven to 425 F
Arrange apples in tart pan, face up.  Pour butter mixture over.
Cover apples with pastry, tucking it down the sides of the pan.
Bake 12-15 minutes, then lower temperature to 350 F and bake 10-12 minutes longer until pastry is risen and crisp.
Let cool a few minutes, then invert onto a warm plate and serve warm.</p></body></html>
