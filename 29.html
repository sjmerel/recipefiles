1/2 to 3/4 lb fresh salmon
fresh dill, chopped, about 2 tbs
1-2 fresh lemons
extra virgin olive oil
kosher salt
fresh ground pepper

Cook the salmon--I usually sear it in a hot pan w/ olive oil, which gives you
nice crunchy bits, but grilling would be good too. Let it cool a little and
flake it. Whisk together lemon juice and olive oil--about 1/3 lemon to 2/3 oil,
add salt and pepper and adjust to taste. Mix together orzo, salmon, dressing
and dill, adjust seasoning. Best room temperature--keep some lemons and oil
handy for leftovers out of the fridge as they usually need a little moistening.
