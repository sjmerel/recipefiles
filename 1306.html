Always a favorite for guests requesting care packages.
ALSO!  I use prepackaged stuffing mix like Pepperidge Farms for my bread crumbs.  Always good and plenty avail. to cover the casserole.
ALSO:  Extra cheeseÂ¦  Whatever looks good to you, it all works.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 1/2 pounds fresh broccoli
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1 t. minced onion
1/2 t. salt
1 t.Worcestershire sauce
2 T. grated Cheddar cheese
1/4 c. butter or margarine
1/2 c. bread crumbs
1/8 t. pepper

Prepare broccoli by washing and trimming off tough ends. Slice into crowns/flowerettes with some stem. (Comfortable slightly larger then bite size pieces) (I lightly steam til still firm) but recipe says to cook in boiling water with salt, covered with lid until tender crisp.  Approximately 10 min.
Place broccoli in 1 qt. BUTTERED casserole dish.  In bowl, mix together eggs, onions, salt, worcestershire, cheddar cheese and 2 Tablespoons melted butter.
Pour over broccoli.
Add bread crumbs and pepper to rest of melted butter.  Spoon over broccoli and pat down.  Be sure to cover flowerettes.
Bake 350 degrees for 30 minutes.
