Chop chocolate and transfer to a large bowl and set aside.

In another bowl whisk the egg yolks with the remaining 6 TB of sugar

Remove hot milk mixture and add a little bit  to the egg yolk mixture a little at a time, whisking as you pour, to temper the yolks. Pour the tempered yolks back  into the rest of the hot milk mixture.

This is your custard, cook over low heat, stirring constantly until mixture is thick  enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon,. About 7 minutes.

Remove custard from the heat and pour over the chopped chocolate. Stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth. 

Add the ovaltine and stir until well combined. Let cool completely and strain the custard through a fine sieve. Let mixture cool in the ice bath to keep th eggs fromm cooking.

Cover and chill for at least 4 hours.

Freeze in an ice cream maker according to manufacturers instructions.
