However, both of them are too cakey for me.  I am an edge-piece person, craving the chewy bits around the corners of the pan.  This recipe, from Alice Medrich's "Bittersweet" (thanks again Sarah Jane) is chewier than the others because of the reduced flour and higher temperature.  I may try baking these in a muffin tin, just to maximize edges.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">4 oz unsweetened chocolate, chopped
8 tbsps (1 stick) unsalted butter
1 1/4 cups sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp salt
2 cold large eggs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup walnuts, if you like that sort of thing, which personally I am opposed to

Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F.  Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square baking pan with foil or parchment.

Melt the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water.  Stir frequently until completely melted.

Remove the bowl from heat and add vanilla, sugar, and salt.  Add eggs one at a time, mixing completely before adding the second.  Stir in flour and beat until smooth and glossy.  Stir in nuts, if you are a crazy person who doesn't know how to make good brownies that others will enjoy.

Scrape batter into pan and bake for 20 minutes or until brownies just begin to pull away from edges of pan.  The surface will look dry, but  a toothpick should come out gooey.

Remove brownies from oven and place pan in an ice water bath, being careful not to get them wet.  When fully cooled, remove them from the pan and cut them into squares.
