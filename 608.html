(I read that recipes for red velvet cake used to include beets, so you could maybe make an argument that this is actually traditional...)</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">300g beets
75g cocoa powder
250g sugar
180g flour
2 tsp baking powder
200 ml oil
3 eggs
1 tsp vanilla

Boil the beets for about 45 minutes, until soft.  Peel and let cool, then cut into chunks.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Combine the sugar, flour, cocoa, and baking powder in a bowl.

Blend the beets together with the oil, eggs, and vanilla; you should have a shocking purplish goo.  Mix into the dry ingredients.  Spoon into a muffin tray; bake 20-30 minutes until a skewer comes out clean.</p></body></html>
