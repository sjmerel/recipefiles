Amazing recipe.  </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">4 eggs, beaten
2 1/4 cups milk
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 to 3  T.  vanilla
1 t. orange peel, finely shredded
1 to 2 t. allspice
4 cups dry French bread cubes (hearty grain bread works well)
1/2 cup dried apricots, chopped
1/4 cup golden raisins

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a bowl beat eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla, orange peel and allspice.  In an ungreased 2 qt. square baking dish toss bread cubes and dried fruit.  Pour egg mixture evenly over bread mixture.  Bake for 40 to 45 minutes.  Cool slightly.

Sauce:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup granulated sugar
2 egg yolks, beaten
4 T water
2 to 3 T. Grand Marnier to taste (I get the little bottles at the liquor store, they come in handy for this recipe)

In a small saucepan melt butter.  Stir in sugar, egg yolks, and water.  Cook over medium heat and stir constantly for 5 to 6 minutes until sugar dissolves and mixture boils.  Remove from heat.  Stir in Grand Marnier.  Serve warm with pudding.
