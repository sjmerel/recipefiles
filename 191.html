It's from Cook's Illustrated.  You can freeze leftover biscuits in a ziplock and reheat them by wrapping them in foil and putting them in a 425 degree oven for about 10 minutes.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2 cups (10oz) ubleached all-purpose flour
1 tbsp double-acting baking powder
1 tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp baking soda
4 tbsps cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/4 inch cubes
1 1/2 cups cold buttermilk, preferably low-fat

additional 2 tbsps melted butter for brushig tops, and some flour

1. Pre-heat oven to 500.  Spray 9-inch round cake pan with cooking spray.
2. In a food processor, pulse flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and baking soda to combine, about 6 1-second pulses.  Scatter butter cubes over dry ingredients and then pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, 8 to 10 1-second pulses.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Add buttermilk and stir until just incorporated.  The dough will be very wet and slightly lumpy.
3. Using a 1/4 cup measure greased with cooking spray, scoop dough and drop onto a plate or baking sheet covered with flour.  Roll gently in flour to coat and form a ball with it in your hands.  Shake off excess flour and place in cake pan.  Repeat 12 times, putting 9 around the edge and 3 in the middle.  Brush tops gently with melted butter.
4. Bake 5 minutes, then reduce temperature to 450 and bake until biscuits are deep golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Coll in pan 2 minutes, than invert biscuits onto plate or kitchen towel, turn them right side up, split them apart.  Cool another 5 minutes or so before eating, or they will be too damp in the middle.</p></body></html>
