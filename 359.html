This may be the chocolate chip cookie recipe that has the right balance of chewy and crispy.  It's certainly good.  It's from The Rose Bakery cookbook - so the recipe for the American cookies made in an English bakery in Paris. I guess  it had to be a pretty good recipe to survive the journey...</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1/2 cup, 100g softened butter
1/2 cup, 100g vanilla sugar, or regular caster sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla extract (if not using vanilla sugar)
1 egg, beaten.
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking soda
1 1/3 cups 175g flour (she says all purpose, i use self raising and nothing terrible happens)
75g (1/4 bar) good quality dark chocolate


Heat oven to gas mark 4, 180/350.  
Beat the butter with the sugar until fluffy, add vanilla if using. 
Mix in the egg. 
Sift together the flour, salt and baking soda, then add them to the butter and sugar. 
Smash up the chocolate with the end of end of a rolling pin, then stir that into the mixture. 
Turn out onto a floured surface, roll into a log shape, then wrap in cling film and chill - in fridge for 2 hours or impatiently in freezer for 30mins. 
Butter a baking tray and line it with parchment if you have it. 
Cut dough into 1/4 inch slices and place them well apart on the tray - these are the kind that sprawl. 
Bake for about 12 minutes or until lightly golden. 
Cool. Eat.
