Mm-mm good. I usually make 4 chops and slightly lessen the rest of the ingredients, depending on chop size. I don’t have a meat thermometer, so heretofore I have ignored that part of the directions, but am still alive to tell the tale. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">8 (1 inch thick) pork chops
 sea salt
fresh ground black pepper
2 1/2 tablespoons butter
1 pound (about 8) large shallots (bulbs separated and each bulb halved lengthwise) 
1 cup hard cider
 
Special equipment: an instant-read thermometer 

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. 

Pat pork chops dry and sprinkle both sides with sea salt and pepper. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then brown chops in 2-3 batches, depending how many you have, turning once, 6 minutes per batch, and transfer with tongs to a large shallow baking pan (1 inch deep). 

Add shallots and remaining tablespoon butter to skillet and cook over moderate heat, turning occasionally, until golden brown and tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Add cider and boil, stirring and scraping up brown bits, until reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 3 minutes. 

Spoon shallots and sauce around chops and roast in lower third of oven until thermometer inserted horizontally into center of 1 chop (do not touch bone) registers 150 degrees F, 7 to 9 minutes. 

Let chops stand, loosely covered with foil, 5 minutes (temperature will rise to 155 degrees F while standing). Serve chops with shallots and sauce. 

Makes 8 servings. </p></body></html>
