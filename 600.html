It's a great sopping bread for soups, sauces, gravy, juicy meats, etc...Also good for sandwiches and by itself.
It's best cooked on the grill but still really, really good cooked on the stove top. My favorite is the lightly carmelized onion version. 
Rolled out dough will  keep overnight in the fridge.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Ingredients

1 C warm H20
1 Tsp. Dry active yeast
1 C plain full fat yogurt
2 tsp salt
5-6 C AP flour
4 Tb unsalted butter - melted

1.Combine yogurt butter and yeast mix well and let sit for five minutes.

2.Combine flour and salt. Add this gradually to yogurt mixture. If dough becomes to stiff to mix add a little warm water 1 TB at a time.

3.Knead by hand for 5 or 6 minutes until dough becomes smooth and shiny.

4.Place dough in a clean bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temp for +/- 20 min.

5.Portion dough into 2 oz. pieces. Roll very thin (tortilla thickness) with a rolling pin. Layer rolled out pieces on flour-dusted parchment or waxed paper until ready to cook.

6.The naan may be cooked in an ungreased skillet (cast iron is the best) on med high heat. Or you can cook it on a grill. Cook about 2 minutes per side or until desired level of doneness.

Optional Hoo Ha
- Stir chopped, lightly caramelized onions into the dough before you add the flour.
- You can add spices or seeds to the flour before you mix it into the wet ingredients. Ground fennel, fennel seed, and cumin are tasty options.
