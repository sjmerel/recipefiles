Like, we're leaving in an hour and I realize this. Please tell me I'm not the only one!! 

This is the PERFECT dessert for the last minute. It takes only a few  ingredients, just dump it in the baking dish and pop in the oven. Talk about a crowd-pleaser, too! I brought this to a baby shower and had several comments on how good it was. Who doesn't love a fresh fruit cobbler? Yum!

1 pint fresh or frozen strawberries (thaw if frozen)
1 cup sugar
1 cup baking mix (I used my homemade DIY Baking Mix)
1 egg
1 stick butter, melted

Quarter strawberries and place in the bottom of a square baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix together sugar and baking mix. Stir in egg, mixture will be clumpy. Sprinkle over strawberries in dish. Drizzle butter over baking mix. Bake at 350 for 35-40 minutes, or until browned. Serve with whipped cream if desired.
