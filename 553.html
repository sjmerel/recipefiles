They are a tasty snack.  The biscuit recipe is from The Joy of Cooking.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 3/4 cups sifted flour
1/2 tsp salt
3 tsp baking powder
4-6 tbsp chilled butter or shortening
3/4 cups milk
Cheese
Ham

Preheat oven to 450.  Mix dry ingredients.  Cut shortening into dry ingredients, then make a well in the center.  Pour in the milk.  Stir until the dough is free from the sides of the bowl.  Knead.  Roll the dough particularly thin.  Prepare the biscuits by cutting out a circle, adding a slice of cheese and ham to the top, cutting out another circle to go on top, and then pinching off the sides to seal in the cheese and ham.  Brush the tops with milk.  Bake until lightly browned - 12 to 15 minutes.</p></body></html>
