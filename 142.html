Diantha sent it to me.  If you don't have a tagine, just use a large, heavy-bottomed pot with a lid.

Good with couscous and a salad on the side.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">4 large bone-in chicken breasts
3/4 cup onion, chopped
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp smoked paprika
1/4 tsp saffron
2 cups green olives (or to taste)
1/2 preserved lemon, chopped
Juice of 1 lemon
Salt and pepper


Arrange chicken in bottom of tagine.  Sprinkle onion, cilantro, parsley, garlic, cumin, ginger, paprika, saffron, salt and pepper over the chicken.

Add 2 cups of water and cover.

If using a tagine, set on a flame tamer (or whatever you can rig up) over medium heat.  If using a pot, set over medium high heat and don't worry about the flame tamer.  Bring to a boil.  Immediately reduce the heat and simmer gently for 30 minutes.</p></body></html>
