By Ana Sortun; Chef/owner of Oleana Restaurant in Cambridge.
This is seriously addictive and a tad bit stronger than your average sangria.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2Tb. + 1 Tsp. whole coriander seeds 
1 cup fresh squeezed OJ (Use the best oranges you can find.)
1/2 C sugar
2 C. dry, floral white wine like a Verdejo or a  Chenin Blanc from the Loire 
Should be a fairly decent wine but doesn't have to be pricey.
1 C. cognac or extremely good brandy
1 C. Sparkling H20
A splash or two of Cointreau - optional
1/8 Tsp. Orange blossom water - optional but it adds a nice brightness. Be careful when pouring, it's super strong..

2 Tb brown sugar or turbinado sugar - For rimming the glass
1 or 2 oranges for slicing

Toast seeds over Med. high heat in a saute pan until fragrant
Remove one teaspoon of the seeds and set aside

Add OJ and sugar to the remaining seeds and bring to a boil.
Turn off heat and throw mixture in  a blender pitcher and cover.
Infuse syrup for fifteen minutes to a half hour.
Buzz OJ and seeds in the blender and strain juice into a pitcher.
Add the rest of the ingredients, orange slices and ice.

*Add more OJ and/ or sugar to taste if it's too strong..

For glass rimming sugar:
Finely grind reserved seeds in a spice grinder and mix them with the two tb. of  brown or turbinado sugar or a combination of the two sugars together.
