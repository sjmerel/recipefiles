It works in summer and winter, goes with everything and is robust enough to be enjoyed on its own. As we confirmed yesterday at the first proper barbecue of the year (it's been a terrible year), it's especially fine with grilled/roast lamb. The recipe is originally Peter Gordon's.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2 450g tins of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
200ml olive oil
3 red chillies, deseeded and finely chopped
12 cloves of garlic, peeled and roughly chopped
3 red onions, peeled and finely sliced
150ml cider vinegar

1 cup roughly chopped fresh coriander leaves
1 cup fresh flat parsley leaves
1 cup roughly crumbled feta
1 cup sliced spring onions
1 cup fresh mint leaves
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil

Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the chilli, garlic and onions. Cook over a high heat for 5 minutes or so, stirring quite frequently to prevent sticking. (Although I have also cooked slowly when I haven't been able to be around to stir and it works fine). Add the vinegar and boil for a couple of minutes. Combine this  mixture with the chickpeas in a large bowl while still warm. 

Add the remaining ingredients and mix well. (When the herbs go in, take a big sniff - I challenge your mouth not to water). Leave to sit for 15 minutes, then check for seasoning. Serve warm if you can, although it'll be fine cold.</p></body></html>
