A fairly thin but very tasty pancake.  I usually eat with sour cream and fruit on them.  Kids think that various amounts of whipped cream, syrup, chocolate sprinkles, etc are required.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1/2 cup almond flour
3/4 cups tapioca flower
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/4 cups buttermilk (*)
2 eggs
4 tbsp butter
1 tbsp syrup (**)

Mis the dry.  Melt the butter.  Mix the wet.  Cook per normal pancakes.

(*) In a pinch you can make your own buttermilk with 1 tbsp of lemon juice or vinegar per cup of milk.

(**) Can be omitted, and should be if you plan to serve with syrup on them.</p></body></html>
