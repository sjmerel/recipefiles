1 Tablespoon black mustard seed (Don't substitute yellow mustard seed!)
2 Tablespoons olive oil, ghee or clarified butter
2 onions, chopped
4 Tablespoons mild curry paste Red, yellow or green paste will work. Use whatever floats your boat
1 can (12-2/3 oz.) canned tomatoes
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1 cup coconut milk
2 carrots, diced or thinly sliced
7 oz. cauliflower florets
2 Japanese eggplants, sliced or cubed. If you use the big dark purple italian eggplants you should peel them first.
7 oz. green beans, halved
5 oz. broccoli florets
2 zucchini - halved lengthwise and sliced
3 oz. baby button mushrooms - halved
salt to taste

Place mustard seeds in a dry pan and heat until they
start to pop. Add ghee or oil and onions to the pan,
cook, stirring until the onions are just soft.  Add
the curry paste and stir for 1 minute until the
mixture is fragrant.

Add the tomatoes, yogurt, and coconut milk, stir over
low heat until combined.  Add the carrots and simmer
uncovered for 5 minutes.

Add cauliflower and eggplants, simmer 5 minutes.  Stir
in remaining ingredients and simmer uncovered 10-12
minutes.  Serve hot with steamed rice.
