I'm still debating finer details, like how much cinnamon and nutmeg to have.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2 cups peaches (*)
1 1/2 cups oat flour
1 cup orange juice
2 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp nutmeg

Put peaches in blender.  Mix all ingredients.  Cook pancakes.  When pouring batter in the pan, you should spread it out with your spoon.  They are ready to flip when the top changes colour.  Be warned that they cook somewhat slowly.

(*) I thaw out a 2 cup bag of frozen peaches for this.</p></body></html>
