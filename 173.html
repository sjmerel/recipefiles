I made it for the first time last night, based on a recipe cribbed somewhere from the Internet, and it is simple peasant genius: easy to do, ridiculously cheap, comforting on a cold Toronto night, and, not least, delicious. The cabbagey taste, not to everyone's liking, is tamed right down by the initial boiling.
It could be a side dish with other stuff, but is just fine on its own. And by adding a lot more milk, you could have a really good soup. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">


Ingredients
3 cups finely shredded green cabbage
1 onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup water
6 cooked potatoes, mashed 1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup butter 
salt and pepper to taste

Put cabbage, onion, and water in saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer, cover, and cook for about 10 minutes
or until tender, not mushy. Add mashed potatoes, milk and butter  and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well to blend and heat
through. 
Serve warm. </p></body></html>
