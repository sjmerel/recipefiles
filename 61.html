I can only really guess at what the recipe really is, it's pretty much illegible now. But I make this week after week in the autumn and winter, it's delicious with tea, but also for breakfast. Hen's brother Ed has had it twice; the first time he said it was the best cake he'd ever tasted; the second time (about 2 weeks later), he said it was the only cake he'd tasted that was as good as the cake he'd eaten 2 weeks earlier. My cranberries had sunk, so he thought it was a different recipe. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">50g plus 125g unsalted butter 
150g plus 125g caster sugar 
175 g cranberries 
125g self-raising flour 
pinch of salt 
1 tsp allspice 
1 tsp cinnamon 
2 large eggs 
1 - 1 1/2 tbsp milk 

Preheat the oven to 180C / gas mark 4 / 400F, and put in a baking sheet to heat up at the same time. 
Put the tarte tatin dish (or any dish you can put on the hob and in the oven) on the hob over a medium heat and melt the 50g of butter. Add the 150g of sugar, stir, then add the cranberries. (Nigella says 'coat the cranberries in the syrup', which always worries me, because i have nothing like a syrup, it's far too thick for that. Still, it turns out nice enough). 
Set aside while you get on with the cake. 
Mix the flour, salt, cinnamon, 125g of butter, 125g sugar and the eggs, ideally in a processor, but happily in a bowl. Add milk to make a soft, dropping batter. 
Pour it over the berries in the pan, then put the pan onto the heated baking sheet in the oven. Cook for 30 minutes or until the cake is bouncy, golden and coming away from the edges. 
Take out of the oven and place a plate on top of the pan. Turn upside down and lift the pan off. Don't burn yourself. You probably will, but don't. 

Eat warm or cold. By jimminy it's good. </p></body></html>
