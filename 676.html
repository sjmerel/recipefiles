1.33 cups	  water
1  egg
1 tbsp	  oil
1 tbsp	  honey
1/2 tsp	  salt
3 cups	  flour, whole wheat
1/3 cup	  oats
1/4 cup  ground flax seeds
2 tsp	  yeast

Directions

1. Put all ingredients in bread machine, wet first, then dry. Turn it on a dough cycle and return when that's done (about 1.5 hours).

2. Otherwise, warm water to 105 to 115 degrees F, and dissolve honey in it, then add yeast. Let sit for 5-10 minutes. If it hasn't foamed by then, get fresh yeast.

3. While yeast is rising mix all dry ingredients. When yeast is ready, add that along with egg and oil to the dry ingredients. Let sit in a warm place for about 10-20 minutes.

4. Kneed by hand or with dough hooks (highly recommended) for 10-15 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic.

5. Let rise for 30-60 minutes, or until doubled in size, in a warm place.

6. Now we're where the bread machine and doing it by hand meet.

7. Preheat oven to 200 degrees for 3-4 minutes, then turn it off.

8. On a lightly oiled surface, kneed the dough for 3-5 minutes, enough to remove major air bubbles.

9. Divide into 14 rolls. We like to use a scale to make each roll about 2 oz when wet. Place on baking sheet and let rise in warm oven for 15 minutes.

10. Take out, pre-heat oven to 375 for 5 minutes, then place rolls in oven for 15 minutes.

11. When done, place on cooling racks.
