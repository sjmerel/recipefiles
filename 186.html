500g orzo
fruity evoo
500g feta 
finely shredded zest of 2 lemons
leaves from a small bunch of mint - julienned or torn into very small peices
freshly ground pepper
Juice from 1/2 a lemon

Cook orzo in salted water. Drain, refresh under cold water then drain again. 
Transfer to a bowl, drizzle with olive oil and stir to separate grains, then 
set aside to cool. Crumble the feta and add to pasta with lemon zest, juice and 
mint. Dress with olive oil to taste (I use a lot here) and season with 
pepper.
