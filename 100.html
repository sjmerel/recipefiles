1 Leg of Lamb (1.5 - 1.8 kg) 'butterflied' by the butcher.

Marinade:
2 cloves garlic crushed to a paste
1 teaspoon sweet Spanish paprika
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped or pounded
1 tablespoon olive oil
black pepper

Put the lamb in a shallow dish. Mix together all the ingredients for the marinade except the olive oil. Then rub the marinade all over the lamb, add the olive oil and leave to marinate for a minimum of one hour. Then make the Escalivada (see below).

When you are ready to cook the lamb, season it well and put it on a hot barbecue for about 5-8 minutes either side for pink, turning once or twice. Remove and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.


Escalivada:
2 large whole red peppers
1 large Spanish onion
2 aubergines
4 sweet tomatoes
1 small bunch flat leaf parsley


Put the onions and the tomatoes on the barbecue first because they need extra time to sweeten and concentrate their flavours. Then put the aubergines and peppers on until their flesh is charred and soft. By the time they are properly done everything will look alarmingly blackened and you will become convinced that you've ruined the whole meal.

Remove the vegetables and cool a little. Peel the charred skin off the peppers, aubergines and onions. Tear the flesh into large strips, the tomatoes in half, discarding the seeds, stalk and core of the peppers. Dress the vegetables with the following dressing while still warm, add the chopped parsley and season.

Sherry Vinegar Dressing:
1 garlic clove
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
a squeeze of lemon
4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
sea salt and black pepper

Crush the garlic with a good pinch of salt in a mortar and pestle until a good paste is formed. Add the vinegar and lemon juice and whisk in the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.</p></body></html>
