It's interesting enough to serve to company, but quick enough to make any time. Good to have handy when vegetarian friends drop in. The original recipe came from Sheila Lukins' "All Around the World" cookbook, but I've changed it a bit over the years to match my taste.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">The sauce:
3 tbsps peanut butter
1 tbsp sesame oil
1 tbsp peanut oil
2 tbsps soy sauce
2 tbsps rice vinegar
2 tsps sugar
2 tsps fresh ginger, peeled
1 clove garlic
juice of 1 lime
chili oil

The rest:
farfalle pasta
optionally, about a cup of steamed broccoli or snowpeas or granny smith apple
scallions, sliced on the bias, for garnish
sesame seeds, for garnish

1. Put all of the sauce ingredients in a blender and puree.
2. Cook the pasta.
3. Adding one of the vegetables dresses it up a bit. For broccoli, chop it loosely and steam it. For snowpeas, blanch them and cut them into matchsticks.  For apple, just core it and chop it into matchsticks.
4. Plate some pasta, pour sauce over it, and top with vegetable, scallion, and sesame seeds.
