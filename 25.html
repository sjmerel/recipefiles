If you don't like your cereal with lots of milk, it probably won't be your kind of thing. In typical Jamie style, the recipe encourages you to "feel free to improvise" but then suggests "you stick to the basic dried ingredients that I use as they work so well together"; my own concoction usually forgoes the dates, apricots, and walnuts, and substitutes dried cranberries or cherries, and flax seeds. I often can't be bothered with the grated apple. Half a banana sliced up is less trouble. I almost always add a couple of spoonfuls of yogurt in the morning to my bowl of pukkolla and some fresh fruit (like blueberries) if we have it. 
Note: the name comes from Jamie Oliver's use of the word "pukka", a British slang term of approval, which rhymes with "sucka".

Milk to cover 
1 Granny Smith apple, washed, unpeeled, cut in half 

I would definitely try to make this the night or day before you want to eat it, although it can be made at the time (although you won't get the smooth silky scrumptious texture that the milk gives it overnight). I normally place double the amount of composed cereal I need (ie. 4 portions for 2 people) into a bowl. Doubling up like this gives you enough to eat for the next couple of days. Cover with milk, grate in half an apple per person and stir immediately to stop the apple discoloring. Place in the refrigerator. 

Composed Cereal: 
8 large handfuls organic Scottish porridge oats 
2 large handfuls ground bran 
1 large handfuls chopped dried apricots 
1 handful chopped dried dates 
1 handful crumbled walnuts 
1 handful smashed or chopped almonds, hazelnuts or Brazil nuts. Add porridge oats and bran to a large plastic container with apricots and dates. Crumble in walnuts and add chosen nuts (I usually bash them in a tea towel). At this point feel free to improvise, adding any other preferred dried fruits like raisins, sultanas, strawberries or figs, but personally I think the above combination works pretty well. This will keep for a good couple of months very happily in an airtight container, but you'll have eaten it by then, I guarantee. The great thing about it is that you can adjust it to your own preference, but I would suggest you stick to the basic dried ingredients that I use as they work so well together. It's very handy to have a large plastic airtight container to store your composed Pukkolla in, so try and get a hold of one. </p></body></html>
