Up the lemon quotient if you like it tart, like I do.    
This is taken nearly verbatim from my father, but I've no idea where he found it originally.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 1/2 lbs chicken breasts (skinned and boned)
1/4 cup flour
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 1/2 Tbsp butter
1 Tbsp finely minced garlic
1 1/2 Tbsp finely minced green onion/scallion
1/4 cup chicken broth
Juice of one lemon
1/4 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup  finely chopped Italian parsley


Strip the chicken of all excess fat, then cut into one inch pieces.
Salt and pepper both sides of the chicken to taste. (My dad says to not skimp on the pepper here.)
Place the chicken in a plastic bag filled with flour and shake until the pieces are covered.
Oil a non-stick pan and brown the chicken on all sides, adding more oil as needed. Sometimes it is necessary to do the chicken in two batches.
In a second pot that can be tightly covered, add the butter and slowly melt.
When both batches of the chicken are ready, add it to the butter pot.
Toss and mix with garlic and green onions.
Add the broth, white wine, and lemon juice, plus the parsley.
Cover the chicken mixture tightly and let simmer for about five minutes. Don't overcook.
Serve on rice, which soaks up the sauce nicely.</p></body></html>
