You'll proably end up making two batches. One doesn't last long.
From the 1st Silver Palate book
</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">6 C. low sodium chicken stock or use home made
1/2 C. jasmine or basmati rice
1/4 C. freshly squeezed lemon juice
3 egg yolks
S&P to taste
Paper thin lemon slices for garnish

Bring stock to a boil
Add rice and cook at slight a simmer until rice is tender - About 15- 20 minutes
Whisk yolks and lemon juice together
When rice is tender gradually add about a cup of hot stock to the yolk mixture whisking continuously the whole time.

Add tempered yolk mixture back to the pot and heat through
DONâ€™T  bring it to a boil, the eggs will curdle.

You can also add chicken meat to the soup. I  sometimes make a stock from thighs and drumsticks when I'm making this soup nad then I have meat to add to the soup as well as a new batch of stock.

Float a paper thin lemon slice on top of the soup when serving. 
A little chopped parsley on top is nice too.
This soup is also amazingly good at room temperature.</p></body></html>
