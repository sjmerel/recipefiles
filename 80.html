The easiest ice cream in the world to make (no tricky custard to contend with), and one of the best tasting.  It also saves you from throwing away bananas that are just too mushy and black to eat... </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">4 very ripe bananas
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 cup vanilla sugar (or regular sugar and add a slug of vanilla essence)
1 cup milk
1 cup heavy cream


Peel the bananas and cut into chunks. Put them into a food processor or blender with the sugar and blend until smooth (or mush with a fork if your boyfriend and his mate have been left alone with your food processor and broken it).
Add the milk and blend again.
Mix in the cream.
Freeze (ideally in an ice-cream maker, which i have no doubt every  one of the foodies reading this owns... certainly all those who've ever made out a wedding list).
Once it's frozen, store in a plastic container, and allow it to soften for 20 mins in the fridge before eating.</p></body></html>
