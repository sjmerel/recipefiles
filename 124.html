It's not one I've made again and again but I have made it on enough special occasions for the page to be spice crusted as well.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">(for 2)
1 pound salmon fillet, skin on
2 tsps crushed coriander seeds
2 tsps cumin seeds
2 tsps dill seeds
2 tsps fennel seeds
1 tsp salt
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 tblsp aquavit
1 tsp caraway seeds
1 tblsp finely chopped fresh chervil
2 tsps white wine vinegar

Toast the coriander, cumin, dill and fennel seeds in a small frying pan over medium heat for about 2 minutes until they start to release their fragrance - which is absolutely delicious. Transfer to a small bowl, add the salt and mix.

Rub the salmon with the spice mixture until you've got a good crust, then place in a baking dish. Sprinkle with one tblsp of the lemon juice. Cover and let marinate in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours.

To prepare the aquavit sour cream, mix together the sour cream, caraway seeds, chervil and a little vinegar in a small bowl,  then add the aquavit in small doses until you find the taste you like. Evidently aquavit is an aquired taste and it's not one that I've fully aquired yet. Nonetheless the mixture is a delicious complement to the spiced salmon.  Maybe those Scandanavian nights are just that much colder...

Preheat the oven to 350F

Place the baking dish with the fish in the middle of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until the fish flakes nicely with a fork.

Serve with the sour cream and maybe Baked Fennel.</p></body></html>
