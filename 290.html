3/4 C chopped red onion
1 C grapes, cut in half
10 strips of bacon crumbled 
3/4 C. sunflower seeds toasted

Dressing:
1/2C Mayo
1/2C Miracle Whip
3/4 C. sugar
2 T. vinegar
1 T. milk

Sir until smooth consistency.  I would recommend making the dressing ahead ( at least a few hours). combine all ingred w/ dressing just before serving. (Can adjust the amount of dressing used - I only used 1/2)</p></body></html>
