It's my go to book when I'm faced with cooking some new food item or finding out how to butterfly a chicken.  I had some iffy bananas and hadn't cared for the fancypants recipes I'd found in books like the Moosewood Book of Desserts. This was a happy and yummy surprise-- even for someone who doesn't like coconut. 

</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">8 tblsp. butter 
3/4 c. sugar
2 eggs
3 very ripe bananas, mashed with a fork until smooth
1 1/2 c. all purpose flour
1/2 c. whole wheat flour
1 tsp. salt
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1/2 c. chopped walnuts or pecans
1/2 c. grated dried unsweetened coconut

Preheat oven to 350. Grease a loaf pan.  
Mix the dry ingredients together in a medium sized bowl. In another bowl cream the butter and sugar together. Beat in the eggs and bananas. Stir this mixture into the dry ingredients; do not mix more than necessary.  Gently stir in the vanilla, nuts, and coconut.

Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, until nicely browned.  (Note, a toothpick inserted should come out fairly clean, but not completely clean. The bananas make this bread moist.)  Do not overcook.  Cool on a rack for 15 minutes before taking out of the pan. Store wrapped in wax paper. Eat the next day toasted with peanut butter! </p></body></html>
