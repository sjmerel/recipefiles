If you think you don't either, give it a try.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Toast 1/2 cup walnuts on sheet tray at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes; set aside.

Cut 24 Brussels sprouts in half and toss in bowl with enough extra-virgin olive oil (2-3 tbs.) to lightly coat each sprout. Season with salt and pepper.

Lay sprouts on sheet tray, and roast in oven at 450 degrees until fork-tender and some leaves have become crunchy (about 20 minutes).

Let sprouts cool, then toss in bowl with crumbled walnuts. Drizzle liberally with olive oil, a squeeze of lemon, and season with salt and pepper. Shave aged pecorino Toscano on top. </p></body></html>
