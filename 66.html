Coarse Sea Salt 
Crushed Black Pepper 
Parsley - finely chopped 
Thyme - finely chopped, in two piles 
Garlic Cloves - crushed 

Vodka 
Olive Oil 
Vegetable Oil 
Unsalted Butter 

Rub the steak with the salt and pepper then marinate in the parsley, the first pile of thyme, the garlic, the olive oil and the vodka, turning twice a day, FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS. Less is not enough. 

Take the meat out of the refrigerator an hour or two before cooking. 

Heat an oven to 200C 425F. 

Setting aside the marinade, sear the meat on a hot skillet. Then transfer to a baking tray, pour the marinade over the meat, and put in the oven for 5 minutes (or so - depending how rare you want it). 

Take the meat out of the oven and let it rest. 

Meanwhile: 

Pour the cooking juices into a saucepan and heat gently. Stir in the butter and season with salt and pepper and the other pile of thyme. 

Carve the meat and serve with the sauce. </p></body></html>
