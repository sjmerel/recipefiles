I eat this at least once a week.  The magic here is the tangy blue cheese with the sweet balsamic vinegar.  Using a good blue cheese makes a big difference.  My favorite is Roquefort, because it has the right mix of salty and creamy and mixes in with the salad well.  Roaring Forties is also very good.

I often make a half-recipe for dinner for myself, washing all the greens from a bag of organic spring mix and keeping the other half in the salad spinner in my fridge.

You can vary this for holiday meals by replacing the bell pepper with some sliced green apple and dried cranberries.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Dressing:
4 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil
2 tbsps balsamic vinegar
1 clove garlic, minced or pressed (optional)
1/2 tsp dijon mustard (optional)
salt and pepper

Salad:
Mixed greens, like mesclun/spring mix
Walnuts or pecans, chopped coarsely
4 scallions, sliced thin
1 red bell pepper, chopped
A good chunk of blue cheese, crumbled
1 boneless chicken breast (optional)

1. If you're using the chicken, rub a little olive oil on it, sprinkle it on both sides with salt and pepper, and broil it or fry it until it's done.  Let it cool and then slice it thinly or shred it with two forks.

2. Wash the greens and dry them in a salad spinner.  You can crisp them up by using ice water to wash them and letting them sit in it for a few minutes.

3. Toast the nuts in a toaster oven or a small pan until they are fragrant.

4. Combine all dressing ingredients in a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake vigorously until well-blended.

5. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and toss together.  It's best to toss them enough for the blue cheese to get well-distributed.</p></body></html>
