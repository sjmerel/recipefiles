Hard-boiled eggs (one per person)
Red onion
Dill
Mayonnaise
Sour Cream
Salt and Pepper

I buy big potatoes and cut them up before cooking them.  They cook more quickly and are easier to cut up as they're less gummy.  For American-style mayo-based salads, I peel them and use about a half-inch dice, for French-style oil-and-vinegar I leave them bigger and may or may not peel them.  Watch the cooking time carefully.  Allow to cool before adding the other ingredients.

I boil eggs using the Sara Moulton method - bring to a rolling boil in plenty of water, immediately remove from the heat, cover and let stand for 20 minutes (I sometimes let them go two or three minutes longer).  Plunge into cold water, tapping the tops and bottoms to break the shells.

The mayo and sour cream should be roughly equal, but I start with the mayo.  Go easy at first as you don't want it too gooshy.

Serve cold.
