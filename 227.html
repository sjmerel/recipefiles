I suppose chips should count as a snack, or at best a "side dish," but I like these with a salad for dinner.  Equally good with wine and beer.  From a Martha Stewart recipe.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Ingredients:
Oil cooking spray
2 pounds russet potatoes cut into 1/4 inch thick slices (note: use a mandoline...this is the best  part of the recipe.  If you don't have one, these potato chips are a good excuse to buy one).
3 Tbs. olive oil  (peanut oil is also good)
Coarse salt
Cayenne pepper
Fresh ground pepper

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Put potatoes, oil, 1 Tbs. salt, pepper, and as much cayenne as seems right into a big bowl and mix it all together.
Arrange potato slices on two baking sheets which you've sprayed lighlty with the cooking oil.  Bake them for 30-45 minutes. 
Because these chips are pretty thin, it's a good idea to rotate the sheets half-way through.  The original recipe doesn't say anything about turning the chips over, but I've found this to be pretty necessary about 10 minutes before they're done.
Spread chips out on a big platter or a sheet of parchment paper for about 5 minutes.  Sprinkle lots more salt on them.
These chips are sort of needy...you have to watch them to make sure they're not burning. But they really do taste better than the deep fried version.</p></body></html>
