It's adapted from a book that she gave me, appropriately enough, a huge tome called _The Glorious Foods of Greece_. It's fascinating to leaf through, but a bit overwhelmingly big, so I haven't cooked from it much. But the other day I knew we had some feta cheese so I looked in the index in search of feta cheese recipes. Sure enough, there was a long list: the one below is probably the simplest. Perhaps because it reminded me of Sarah Jane's cauliflower dish, we ate it with cauliflower roasted in olive oil. If you haven't tried preparing cauliflower this way, you really should. You can microwave the cauliflower for a bit first so it takes less time to roast. Be generous with the olive oil and the salt and crank up the oven so the cauliflower gets really browned. The three of us easily ate a whole head as a side dish. 

I think this soup is going to become a staple for us. It's quick, easy, and tasty. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">a good amount of olive oil (a 1/4 cup?)
chopped onion
1 28 oz can of tomatoes
salt and pepper
3 to 4 cups of good chicken broth or water
1/4 pound short pasta
half a cup crumbled Greek feta cheese, or more to taste

Heat the oil in a large pot on medium heat. Saute the onion and when softened add the tomatoes. Cook for five minutes and then add the broth. Taste and season. Puree with a blender if you like a smooth texture. Add the pasta and cook until tender. Add more broth or water if the soup is too thick. Serve warm, topped with crumbled feta and extra olive oil if you like.</p></body></html>
