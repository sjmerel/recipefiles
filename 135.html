It's super-tasty and is even better the next day.  I recommend that you sprinkle a little extra vinegar in each bowl.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1/4 cup olive oil
8 garlic cloves
2 bunches cilantro (leaves only)
1 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp pepper
1 lb ground turkey or chicken
1 large egg, beaten
2/3 cup fresh breadcrumbs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 large leek - trimmed, washed, julienned
4 medium carrots - peeled, diced
1/4 head cabbage - cored, thinly sliced
1-2 jalapeno peppers - stemmed, seeded, julienned
3 medium Roma tomatoes - cored, seeded, diced
2 1/2 quarts chicken stock
3 Tbsp white vinegar
(for a heartier soup, a handful of rice or pasta)

Combine the olive oil, garlic, cilantro, and 1 tsp each of salt and pepper in the blender.  Mix the turkey, egg, and the cilantro paste in a bowl.  Add the breadcrumbs; mix until combined.  Make walnut-sized meatballs out of the mixture and put then in the refrigerator.

Heat 2 Tbsp vegetable oil over high heat in a stock pot.  Sautee the leeks and carrots with remaining salt and pepper for 2-4 minutes.  Add cabbage, jalapenos, and tomatoes and cook until limp (3 minutes).  Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Simmer 15 minutes uncovered.

Meanwhile, brown the meatballs in a separate pan in vegetable oil; drain on paper towels.  Put them into the stock and cook for 10-15 minutes.  Add the vinegar.
