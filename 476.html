1 c long grain white rice
1/2 lb tasty sausage (we used habanero chile pork sausage from whole foods)
1/2 small onion
1/2 cup or more dried cranberries
2 c chicken broth
Roasting pan
Tin foil

Preheat oven to 400. Boil some water in the kettle. Hollow out pumpkin like a jack o lantern, scoop out the goop and salt the inside a little.  Fry the sausage and onion in a heavy-bottomed saucepan.  Add rice and dried cranberries and let the rice get glossy.  Add the chicken broth, and boil for about 10-15 minutes (the rice will be soupy and not done yet).  I skimmed off a little fat at this point since I used pork sausage.  Wrap the bottom of the pumpkin in foil, put it in the small roasting pan and spoon the rice into it.  Put the lid on, pour about an inch of hot water into the pan around the pumpkin, put in the oven and roast for about an hour, until the pumpkin is soft.  Spoon the rice out onto plates with  a bit of the pumpkin flesh and serve, or cut into wedges.

The original version was vegetarian w/ dried fruit, allspice and ginger.  We skipped the spices as the sausage was heavily spiced.  Easily adapted--I'm thinking sauteed mushrooms, nuts and some other veggie next time.
