If you're feeling decadent, a couple slices of crispy cooked bacon crumbled into this takes it over the top.  This comes from Cook's Illustrated, but I left out their frozen peas because... yuck.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 lb medium pasta shells
2 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
2 tbsps olive oil
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
12 oz (1 1/2 cups) whole milk ricotta
1 cup coarsely chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1/4 cup grated Parmesan
2 tsps chopped fresh mint leaves

1. Cook pasta in salted water until al dente.  Drain, reserving 3/4 cup cooking water, and return pasta to pot.
2. Meanwhile, heat garlic, oil, and red pepper flakes in small pan over medium heat until sizzling but not browned.  Stir together ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes, Parmesan, mint, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and garlic/oil mixture in bowl.  Stir reserved pasta water into ricotta mixture, and then add mixture to pasta pot and stir well to combine.</p></body></html>
