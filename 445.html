1 small box cook and serve Butterscotch pudding (not instant)
1/2 cup butter
1 cup brown sugar
1 rounded teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup chopped nuts

Melt butter on very low heat and add brown sugar and cinnamon.  Mix well.
Generously grease Bundt pan and sprinkle chopped nuts evenly in pan.
Pour butter, brown sugar and cinnamon mixture over nuts.
Stack 18-24 rolls evenly around pan.
Sprinkle dry pudding mix over rolls.
Cover with paper towel and let set on counter overnight (approx. 8 hours)
In morning bake in preheated oven for 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees.
Remove from oven and carefully flip onto a large plate or pie plate.
(make sure plate is larger the Bundt pan so all the gooey stuff doesn't spill)
Enjoy!!</p></body></html>
