I use boneless chicken instead of drumettes, to avoid the fuss of pulling little bones out of your soup, and added some cabbage for a little texture.    Maybe it's no longer authentic... but it's damn tasty.  (Be sure not to skimp on the ginger.)

    * 2 1/4 lbs. boneless chicken thighs
    * 2/3 c. rice
    * 1/2 head cabbage
    * pepper
    * ginger - 2 big thumbs
    * 1 large onion
    * 2 bay leaves
    * 2 Tbs. fish sauce
    * 1 dried serrano pepper
    * 32 oz or 1 qt chicken broth (could use more)
    * lemon wedges

Toast chopped garlic in olive oil and set aside.  Brown chicken. Stir in rice and toast it.  Add all other ingredients and bring to boil.  Let simmer for 20 minutes or until chicken is tender. Serve with toasted garlic, pepper and lemon.</p></body></html>
