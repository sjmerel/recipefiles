1	4-to 4 1/2-pound boneless first-cut beef brisket, trimmed of all fat
3	large onions, about 1 pound (480 g), sliced and separated into rings
3	large garlic cloves, thinly sliced
2	teaspoons (10 ml) ground cinnamon
	freshly ground pepper to taste
1/2	teaspoon (2.5 ml) ground ginger
1	teaspoon (5 ml) paprika
2	teaspoons (10 ml) grated orange zest
8	large fresh plum tomatoes, seeded and finely chopped
2	cups (480 ml) low-sodium canned beef broth
2	small navel oranges
1 1/2	tablespoons (22.5 ml) ground walnuts
1.	Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C), Gas Mark 3. 
2.	In a heavy flameproof casserole or Dutch Oven with lid, heat oil over medium heat. Add brisket and brown on all sides. When brisket is brown, pour off all fat and pan juices. 
3.	Scatter onion and garlic slices around the brisket. Season with cinnamon, pepper, ginger, paprika, and orange zest. Add tomatoes and beef broth. Bring to a simmer. 
4.	Cover and transfer to oven. Roast until brisket is fork tender, about 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 hours. Turn meat and baste with pan juices 2 or 3 times during the cooking time. 
5.	Transfer brisket to a carving board and keep warm. Skim off any fat from casserole and place over medium-high heat on top of the stove. Cook, uncovered, until reduced by half. Pour the sauce through a sieve, pressing the solids to extract their flavor and to thicken the sauce. Return strained sauce to casserole; discard solids. Keep sauce warm. 
6.	Peel oranges, removing all white pith. Thinly slice the oranges and add to the warm sauce. Heat through. 
7.	Slice the brisket across the grain into thin slices. Place on a heated serving platter and nap with the sauce. Sprinkle with ground walnuts.
