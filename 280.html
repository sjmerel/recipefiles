Ingredients:  
  3 Tbs olive oil (they use brown butter at Lula, but olive oil worked well)
  4 oz long pasta (bucatini, linguini, etc)
  1 big clove garlic, sliced
  1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled
  cinammon
  salt & pepper

Boil the pasta.  When it's nearly done, heat the oil in a pan and fry the garlic until it begins to brown, then turn off the heat.  Drain the pasta and put it into the pan; toss with the oil & garlic.  Add the feta and a few generous shakes of cinnamon.  Season with salt & pepper to taste.</p></body></html>
