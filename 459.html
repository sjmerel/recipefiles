From Nigella Lawson's "How To Eat"</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">400g dried chick peas
2 Tbsp salt
3 liters vegetable stock (or meat stock, or white wine and water)
3 sprigs rosemary
8 cloves garlic, peeled and bruised
120 ml extra virgin olive oil
400g fresh tomatoes, skinned and seeded.  (Yeah, right, Nigella -- you go ahead and skin and seed your tomatoes.  I've used the whole tomato or used canned ones.)
270g small tubular pasta
parmesan for grating
chili oil and flat-leaf parsley if you want

    Put the chick peas in a bowl and cover with water; let soak 12-24 hours.  Drain and rinse.
    Put the chick peas in a big pot and add the stock (or wine and water).  Tie the rosemary sprigs in a muslin bag or piece of cheesecloth and add to the pot.  Add the garlic and half the oil.  Cover and bring to boil.  Lower heat to simmer until chick peas are tender (about 2 hours).  Do not add salt until the end (she claims your chick peas will harden otherwise).
    Remove the garlic & rosemary.  Puree the tomatoes and add to the soup with their juice.  Stir well, add salt & pepper to taste and cook another 10 minutes or so.  If cooking in advance, stop here.
    When you want to eat it, reheat it, add the pasta and cook until tender.  Add parsley; sprinkle in cheese, olive oil, and chili oil as desired to each bowl.</p></body></html>
