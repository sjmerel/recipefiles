Ground black pepper
12 thin slices stale French or Italian bread

Add carrots, cook 2-3 minutes.
Add cabbage, cook 2-3 minutes.

Add bouillon cube and enough water to cover by 2 inches.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat.
Cover tightly and simmer for at least 2 and possibly 3 hours.  
Add beans. Stir, taste and correct for salt and pepper.  

(you may prepare the soup up to this point a day or two in advance).

Bake 30 minutes or until completely heated through.</p></body></html>
