Fish Tacos</h1><p>author: perrin</p><p>created: 2004-07-19 15:46:27</p><p>servings: </p><p>notes:</p><p class="recipe">Since I no longer live in The Promised Land, I have to make my own fish tacos now. The ones I got in L.A. were always deep-fried, but that's too messy for me to get into at home, so these are an approximation. I cobbled this together from a few different recipes in Cook's Illustrated.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Spice rub (optional):
2 tbsps ground cumin
1 tbsp chili powder
1 tbsp ground coriander
1 tbsp dried oregano
1 tbsp garlic powder
2 tsps coarse salt
1 tsp cocoa
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper

Sauce:
2 tbsps mayonnaise
1 chipotle chile, minced

The rest:
firm fish fillet, like cod, haddock, or tilapia
about 1 cup chopped romaine lettuce or cabbage
corn tortillas, warmed in a toaster or microwave
1/2 tbsp butter
1/2 tbsp oil
lime wedges

1. If you want to use the spice rub, combine the ingredients and put them in small jar or other container. This makes enough to last for several uses and is good on chicken or pork too.

2. Mix the mayonnaise and chile together to make the sauce.

3. Pat some spice rub onto the fish, and then fry it in a skillet with the butter and oil over medium heat, until golden brown and cooked through.

4. Let the fish rest on a cutting board for a minute and then chop it up loosely. To make the tacos, spread some sauce inside a tortilla and then fill it with the lettuce/cabbage and some fish. Squeeze a lime wedge over the fish just before you eat it. </p></body></html>
