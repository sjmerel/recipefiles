2 lb mixed mushrooms, cleaned and sliced
2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 cup finely chopped shallots
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 large rosemary sprigs
2 tbsp tomato paste/puree
1 cup red wine
1 tsp salt
1/2 lb fontina cheese, grated
1 tub (454 g) smooth ricotta
1/2 cup parsley, chopped
1/4 cup fresh marjoram, chopped
3/4 cup milk
1 lb lasagne noodles

1. Steep porcini mushrooms in 1/2 cup water 15-20 minutes.
2. In large frying pan, heat oil, then add shallots.  Cook, stirring until translucent and just beginning to colour.  Add garlic and rosemary.  
3. Remove rehydrated porcini from water, chop finely.  Strain soaking water through a coffee filter.
4. Add all mushrooms to pan and stir.  Continue to cook, stirring, until mushrooms release their juices.  Add strained soaking water, tomato paste and wine, then season with salt and pepper.  Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes.
5. Mix cheeses, herbs and milk in a bowl.
6. Cook lasagne noodles in boiling water until al dente, about 3 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 375 F
7. In a lightly greased 9X13 inch baking dish, place a layer of noodles, slightly overlapping.  Spread 1/3 of cheese mixture over top, then cover with mushroom mixture.  Place another layer of noodles and repeat.  Place final layer of noodles over mushroom mixture, then spread with remaining cheese mixture.  Bake 1/2 hour or until top is golden and lasagne is bubbling.</p></body></html>
