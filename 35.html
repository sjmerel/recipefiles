I've tried it without cilantro, but it just doesn't work.
</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">4 lb waxy potatoes (red are best)
4 lb fresh mussels
2-3  medium apples (crunchy and tangy are best)
1  large onion
1/2-3/4 c mayonnaise (Miracle Whip won't do)
1-2 T curry powder
  splash of white wine
  good handful of fresh cilantro, chopped
  salt and pepper to taste

Peel and boil potatoes in salted water until cooked, but still firm.
While still warm, cut into 1" dice.
Check mussels carefully, remove beards if necessary and discard any mussels that will not close. Put in large stock pot with splash of white wine and simmer at medium heat until all mussels are fully open, about five minutes.
Peel and dice apples to about half the size of potato dice.
Roughly chop onion
Add potato, apple, onion and chopped coriander to large bowl.
Remove mussels from shells and add, along with a bit of mussel broth.
Add mayonnaise and curry powder and mix well.
Season with salt and pepper to taste and mix again.
Let sit, covered with foil or plastic, in fridge for a few hours for flavors to meld. </p></body></html>
