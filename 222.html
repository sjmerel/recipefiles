Thanks, Grandma!!!  This doubles easily and bakes perfectly in a 9X13 pan.  It really cooks in about the same amount of time--5 to 10 extra minutes, at most.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1/2 cup butter, melted
2 eggs, beaten
1 (8.5 oz.) package of dry cornbread mix
1 (15 oz.) can of whole kernel corn
1 (14.75 oz.) can of creamed corn
1 cup sour cream
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and lightly grease a 9X9 baking dish.  In a medium bowl, combine melted butter, eggs, corn bread mix, whole and creamed corn, sour cream, and cheddar cheese.  Spoon mixture into prepared baking dish.  Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top is golden brown.
