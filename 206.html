"I call a fig a fig; a spade a spade", Menander, 342-292 B.C.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">18 or so whole dried figs (I've used smallish and larger ones)
1 cup white wine
3-4 teaspoons marscapone cheese (I've also used goat cheese)
grated zest of 1 lemon
2-3 tablespoons finely chopped pistachio nuts
2 teaspoons honey
2 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto

1. Bring figs and wine to simmer in a saucepan over low heat until figs are soft (about 5 minutes).  Remove figs with slotted spoon.  Continue cooking wine until syrupy, and reserve it.
2. If using small figs: cut the very tops off of them.  If using large figs, cut off the stem, and then cut them in half.
3. Top 1/3 of the figs with marscapone cheese and lemon zest.
4. Pile the pistachios on a small plate.  Pour honey onto another small plate.  Press the cut side of 1/3 of figs into honey and then into nuts to coat. 
5. In remaining 1/3 of figs, make a small cavity in the centers with your finger.  Cut the prosciutto into 1/2 inch wide strips, roll into a bundle, and press into each fig.  
6.  Arrange all figs on serving platter.  Drizzle prosciutto figs with reserved wine syrup.
