4 to 5 unpeeled clementines (about 1 pound total weight)
6 eggs
1 cup plus 2 Tbsp sugar
2 1/3 cups ground almonds
1 heaping teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
    Put the unpeeled clementines in a pot with cold water to cover, bring to the boil, and cook for 2 hours.
    Drain and, when cool, cut each clementine in half and remove the seeds.
    Then chop everything finely -- skins, pith, fruit -- in the food processor (or by hand, of course). [Sarah's note: I often do scrape out and discard the pith, particularly if I'm making this with lemons.] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Butter and line an 8-inch spring form pan.
    Beat the eggs. Add the sugar, almonds, and baking powder.  Mix well, adding the chopped clementines.  I don't like using the processor for this, and frankly, you can't balk at a little light stirring.
    Pour the cake mixture into the prepared pan and bake for an hour, when a skewer will come out clean; you'll probably have to cover the cake with foil after about 40 minutes to stop the top burning.
    Remove from the oven and leave to cool, on a rack, but in the pan.  When the cake's cold, you can take it out of the pan.  I think this is better a day after it's made, but I don't complain about eating it any time.
 
Variation:
    I've also made this with an equal weight of oranges, and with lemons, in which case I increase the sugar to 1 1/4 cups and slightly anglicize it, too, by adding a glaze made of confectioner's sugar mixed to a paste with lemon juice & a little water.
