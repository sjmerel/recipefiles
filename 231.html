Although it isn't as quick as some.  But that leaves you more time for a pre-dinner drink.  An excellent winter comfort food dish.

My mum gave me this recipe.  No idea where she got it.  But it was a good find.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">One head fennel per person, tough outer layer removed, core roughly chopped and leafy green fennel tops chopped finely
Garlic - 2 cloves per person, peeled
Red Pepper flakes to taste
Olive oil - 1 tbsp per person
Canned tomatoes - about 8 oz per person
Salt and pepper
Fresh basil leaves - about 6 per person, shredded
Mozzarella cheese - about 2 oz per person, grated
Parmesan cheese - about 1 oz per person, grated
Fusilli - 2 cups per person


Preheat oven to 450 degrees fahrenheit
In a baking dish, toss fennel pieces (reserving fennel tops for later), whole garlic cloves, red pepper flakes, tomatoes, salt and pepper.
Bake for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fennel pieces are soft, translucent and beginning to brown.
Combine with cooked pasta, mozzarella, basil and fennel tops.
Serve with grated parmesan passed at the table.
