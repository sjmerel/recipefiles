A moist and  fragrant lemon cake with a layer of fresh reaspberries baked in.  What's not to like?  The olive oil adds moisture and a subtle background flavor. A serious crowd pleaser.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Cake:
1-3/4 c AP flour
1-1/2 tsp BP
1 c sugar
Zest from 2 lemons
4 large eggs
1TB fresh lemon juice
7 Tb melted butter/room temp.
2/3 C mild flavored Extra virgin olive oil. Don’t use the real fruity stuff!
1 Pt. fresh raspberries, washed and dried thoroughly.

Meringue:
2 whites
½ c sugar

- Preheat oven: 350
- 10” Spring form pan, buttered and floured

Sift:
1-3/4 c AP flour
1-1/2 tsp BP
 -Set aside

Combine in a beater bowl:  
1 c sugar
Zest from 2 lemons 
-Mix together with your fingers until sugar is moist, grainy and smells lemony.

Add:
4 large eggs
-Beat at Med. high speed with whisk attachment until pale & thick, about 3 minutes.

-Add at low speed:
3TB whole milk
Sifted dry ingredients
-Mix just until blended.

Add: 
1TB fresh lemon juice
7 Tb melted butter/room temp.
2/3 C mild flavored Extra virgin olive oil. Don’t use the real fruity stuff!
-Mix just until blended.

Pour about 1/3 of the batter into pan. It should be a thin even layer.
Top with enough fresh raspberries (washed and dried thoroughly) to cover the batter
Don’t make a double layer! The inside of the cake will never cook…ever.

Pour the rest of the batter in the pan. Spread gently with spatula so batter drips down between raspberries. The top layer of cake will be very thin, it’s supposed to be that way.

Bake for 30 – 35 minutes until golden brown and starting to pull away from edges and knife inserted in middle comes out clean.
*Sometimes it takes up to 45 minutes to bake, could have been my crappy oven, not sure.

Unmold immediately onto a rack and invert    
Eat when cooled

Topping /optional

You can serve this with whipped cream. It’s so moist it doesn’t really need it or top it with a meringue with gives it a really nice texture and makes it very pretty.

Meringue:
2 whites
½ c sugar

Make a firm meringue and spread it in a wavy fashion on top of cake. Spread about  inch two inches from the edge.
Pop it in a 475 oven until crests of waves/peaks are brown, 4-6 min.

Top the cake with more fresh raspberries.
