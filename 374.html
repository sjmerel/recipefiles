It works really well with corn that is not quite fresh enough to just serve it on the cob.  Would probably work with frozen corn too if you rinse the ice off it well.  The lime juice is the key here for me.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">6 ears of corn, shucked
1 tbsp oil (corn, if you have it)
1 jalapeño or other hot chile, stemmed, seeded and minced, or ½ tsp dried red chili flakes
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups cooked or canned black beans, rinsed, drained and at room temperature
2 ripe medium tomatoes, cored and diced
Fresh squeezed lime juice to taste
Fresh chopped fresh cilantro leaves for garnish.
Salt

1. Stand an ear of corn in a shallow bowl, stem-side down. With a knife, slice kernels off from top to bottom until all are removed. Continue with every ear.

2. Put a large skillet over high heat and add oil; a minute later, add corn and chilies. As corn cooks, shake pan to distribute it so that each kernel is deeply browned on at least one surface.

3. While corn is still in skillet, but with heat off, stir in the garlic and let sit for a minute. Combine in a bowl with remaining ingredients. Taste and adjust seasoning and serve.</p></body></html>
