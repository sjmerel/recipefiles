It took several tries to make them like hers but they are absolutely delicious. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2 pounds confectioners' sugar
1 can sweetened condensed milk
2 cups flaked coconut
1 stick of melted butter 
1 tsp vanilla
3 cups finely chopped pecans

Dipping chocolate [below]

Mix the first five ingredients together, refrigerated for an hour or so. It will be easier to shape them into balls. Refrigerate them again until they become hard. Meanwhile prepare your dipping chocolate. 

Dipping Chocolate
1 cake paraffin wax
1 12 ounce bag of milk chocolate chips. [I prefer the dark chocolate]. 

Melt wax and chocolate chips in a double boiler. Once the mixture starts to melt, put the balls on a stick and roll the in the chocolate. [I tilt the pan to make it easier]. Put on a piece of wax paper. It's well worth the effort! 
Give them as gifts or serve them for the holidays. </p></body></html>
