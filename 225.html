I had this cake there for dessert and was then happy to discover that my Mum had the Moro cookbook at home, so I made it. Mine didn't turn out quite the same as theirs in consistency, but I thought it was equally delicious. It's a very light, refreshing dessert that reminds me of the Indian dessert Ras Malai. The yoghurt cake looks very pretty garnished as they do at the restaurant with pomegranate seeds and pistachios.  </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">3 large eggs
70g caster sugar
2 vanilla pods (split)
350g yoghurt (they suggest a mixture of strained greek & normal yoghurt)
zest of 1 lemon & half orange (finely grated)
juice of 1 lemon
20g plain flour
30g pistachio nuts - unsalted and chopped.

Preheat oven to 180 (350F) & put in bain-marie to warm. Need 25cm round or
square baking tin (with solid bottom or lined).

Beat egg yolks with 3/4 of sugar until thick and pale. Scrape seeds from
vanilla pods and mix into egg-sugar mixture.  Add the yoghurt, lemon and
orange zest, lemon juice and flour and mix well.  In separate bowl whisk egg
whites with the remaining sugar until soft peaks form.  Gently and evenly
fold the whites into the yoghurt mixture.  Pour mixture into baking tin.
Place tin in the bain-marie, making sure that the boiling water comes half
way up the tin.  Cook for about 20 minutes. Then add chopped pistachios,
sprinkling them on the top and continue to cook for a further 20 minutes or
until top is light brown.  They say the correct consistency should be a light sponge on
top with wet custard below, but actually when I made it it was more like a damp, moussey cake throughout--which was very nice. Serve with yoghurt and fruit.</p></body></html>
