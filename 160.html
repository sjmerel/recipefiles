You don't really need a recipe to tell you how to dress a pile of roasted red peppers, but the flavour combination here is particularly tasty, similar to that of Claire and Hen's escalivada. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">3 small red peppers
3 tbsp. olive oil
50 ml sherry vinegar
a spring of thyme, finely chopped
a sprig of rosemary, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1 tbsp. capers, rinsed and drained
1 tbsp. chopped parsley
salt and pepper
thinly sliced bread, to serve

Grill or roast the peppers, however you prefer to, until skins are blackened. Transfer to a plastic bag, seal, and allow to steam. Place a sieve over a bowl and, when cool, hold the peppers over the sieve and peel, removing seeds and membranes if you haven't already. Cut the peppers into strips (I used scissors) as you go, placing the stips in the sieve. Heat a skillet, and add oil, thyme, rosemary, garlic, cayenne, sherry vinegar, and the pepper juices that should have collected in the bowl beneath the sieve. Be careful when you add the vinegar, as the oil may sputter. Cook over low heat for 2 minutes. Add peppers, capers, parsley, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Serve at room temperature with or on bread with drinks. It will keep in the fridge for up to a week. </p></body></html>
