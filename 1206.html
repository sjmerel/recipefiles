It's very peppery, so not a big hit with the kids, unfortunately.  I often end up making half the tofu with this sauce for us, and half with the #2 sauce for them.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 lb firm tofu, cut into small cubes
2 Tbsp chopped fresh ginger
1/2 onion, finely chopped
5 cloves garlic
2 Tbsp black pepper (yes, Tbsp)
4 Tbsp soy sauce
1 1/2 Tbsp sugar
8 scallions, cut into 1" pieces

Fry the tofu in some vegetable oil until somewhat browned; set aside.  Cook the ginger, garlic, and onion on medium-low heat with a bit of oil for 10-15 minutes until soft.  Add the soy sauce, sugar, pepper, and tofu, and heat up for a minute or two, then stir in the scallions.</p></body></html>
