Be sure to meet eyes as you toast one another. This really does make everything else taste better. 

Have on hand the following:
2 med. salmon steaks (or any sturdy fish: monkfish or swordfish or tuna would work,0,0,0,0,0,0,0); 1 bag washed baby spinach; 
1 bag washed arugula (rocket,0,0,0,0,0,0,0);
olive oil and balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper
10-15 small white potatoes, skins left on
butter
fresh parsley
red or white wine

Wash pototaes and place in boiling salted water.  If they are too large to cook in 15 minutes, cut them in halves or quarters. Chop parsley and set aside.  Cube up 2-3 tbsp. butter and set aside.

Then rinse and pat dry two medium-sized salmon steaks; salt and pepper each side.  Heat up olive oil in a sturdy frying pan or wok until a pat of butter, approximately 1 tbsp., will sizzle.  Add the butter and the fish, searing both sides until brown, approximately 1 minute per side.  Turn fish skin side down, lower flame to medium, and cover dish for five more minutes, or so, depending on the thickness of the fish.  Be careful not to let the steaks dry out.  A little pinkness in the center of the salmon is a good thing. 

Drain potatoes and return to pot.  Add butter and parsley.  Get out two large plates. 

On each plate, arrange a handfull of spinach and arugula.  You could mix them now, but why bother?  You have love to make, not dinner!

Set the fish next to the salad.  Now pour approx. 3/4 tbsp. oil and 1/2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar over salad.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Don't worry if the dressing seeps under the fish.  This is also a good thing. 

Now set a few potatoes on the plate and serve!  With another glass of wine, of course. 

If you have any potatoes left, refridgerate. On the following morning, you can slice them into disks and set individually on a pan into the oven--no need to add butter--they'll bake up as a delicious accompaniment to scrambled eggs. </p></body></html>
