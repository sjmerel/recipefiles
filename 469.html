1 can 11 oz. mandarin oranges, drained
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup crumbled feta or blue cheese
1/2 cup toasted, or candied nuts-almonds, walnuts or macadamias

Raspberry dressing
In a food processor, using the steel blade, combine:
1 clove minced garlic
1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard
1 cup salad oil or light olive oil
1/2 cup Balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup raspberry freezer jam

Add the garlic, salt, pepper and mustard to the workbowl and combine.
Add the oil and slowly drizzle in the vinegar throught the feedtube.  Add raspberry jam, taste and correct the balance of sweetness, if desired.
Raspberry freezer jam is available in the freezer section.  Jam that is heat processed and comes in jars does not give the fresh zingy taste.  Store dressing in a covered container in the refrigerator.  This makes about two cups or enough for two batches of the salad.  Consider using fresh mangoes for the oranges and thinkly sliced red onion for the nuts.
