It started as plain veggie chili when I arrived at McGill, then somehow got mixed up with a Spanish Rice recipe, and now is just a basic, easy to do when you are hungry and want something fast.

And a good excuse to drink beer.  If you needed one.  </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">For the Beans and Rice

1/2 cup white long grain rice
1 12 oz can black beans
1 12 oz can pink beans (or pinto)
1 12 oz can corn 
1 12 oz crushed tomatoes
4-5 garlic cloves, chopped or sliced fine
1 large onion, chopped medium fine
2 Tblsp veg. oil
Chili powder

For the Rest

Guacamole
Hot Sauce
Sour Cream
Lettuce
Salsa
Tortillas

Cook the rice (I will leave rice cooking as a given here...)

Heat the oil in a large saucepan (this makes a lot), medium high heat
Add the onions and garlic and cook until soft and translucent
Add the rice, beans, corn, crushed tomatoes and stir until well mixed.
Add as much chili powder as you can stand.
Turn heat to low and simmer. 

While simmering, pull together your condiments.  I typically heat the tortillas in a non-stick skillet over high heat, but you may have something better.

Put some beans and rice in a tortilla, whatever else on top of it you like, and have some messy fun!</p></body></html>
