From Bon Appetit. A good fall/winter meal. 

We also included pancetta in this recipe, prepared a la Claire and Hen's "Taleggio, Bacon and Watercress Risotto", using a little bit of pancetta grease as a starting point. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">6 cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth)
1/4 cup cream Sherry

1 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1 small white onion, chopped
1/2 small butternut squash, peeled, seeded, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
1 1/2 cups (10 ounces) arborio rice
2 cups peeled roasted chestnuts (or jarred chestnuts), chopped
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon chopped fresh marjoram
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italy parsley

Bring chicken broth and Sherry to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to low; cover and keep warm.

Meanwhile, heat oil and 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and squash; cook until onion is translucent, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Add rice; stir until rice is translucent at edges but still opaque in center, about 3 minutes. Add 1 cup warm broth; simmer until almost absorbed, stirring often, about 4 minutes. Add more broth, 1 cup at a time, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding next until rice is just tender, stirring frequently, about 25 minutes total. Stir in chestnuts, thyme and majoram (and pancetta, if you choose to include that). Remove from heat; stir in remaning 1 tablespoon butter, cheese and parsley. Season risotto with salt and pepper and serve. </p></body></html>
