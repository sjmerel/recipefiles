Every few weeks I make soup.  After one disaster I was asked to write down what I did to guarantee a good soup.  After this soup I was asked to not tinker any more.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">First:
Take 2 cooked chickens.  Separate meat and bones.  Put meat in fridge.

Stock:
In a crock pot I place (chopped, etc as appropriate):
- Bones from several chickens
- Stems from 4 stems of broccoli
- 1 onion
- 1 bunch celery
- 2 large cloves garlic
- 1 lb carrots
- 3 bay leaves
- 1 cup vinegar
- 2 tbsp caraway seeds
- 3 tbsp black peppercorns
- 3 tbsp garam masala
- 2 tbsp majoram
- 2 tsp sage
- 1 tbsp salt
- Enough water to almost fill the pot.  (Leave space b/c water expands when heated.)

Put on a low simmer for at least 4 hours.  (Overnight is fine.)

Take everything out of the liquid.  I use a fish net from the pet store to be sure I get the bones, etc.

Soup:
- meat from 2 chickens
- 1 lb carrots, chopped
- heads from 4 stems of broccoli

Bring back to a boil, simmer for at least one hour.

Divide into containers, freeze what you want. </p></body></html>
