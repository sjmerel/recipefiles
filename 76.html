2 cups yellow cornmeal
salt and ground black pepper 
cayenne pepper
*at least 1.5 cups buttermilk---regular milk with a splash of vinegar will do in a pinch
oil or cooking spray for greasing pan

The amounts here are approximate. I usually take a mound of cornmeal, mix in the salt and pepper and cayenne till it doesn’t just look like cornmeal, and dredge till there’s none left---then make a bit more of the mixture for the last piece or two of fish. 

Preheat oven to 375F. 

In a bowl, mix the cornmeal with about 2 teaspoons pepper and 1 teaspoon salt, and then a few shakes of cayenne.  

Pour buttermilk in a bowl and dunk the a piece of fish in it, then dredge it in the cornmeal mixture and place on a greased pan. The more cornmeal is on there, the crispier, so don’t be shy about sprinkling on extra mixture. 

Place in oven and cover loosely with a sheet of tinfoil for the first 15 minutes. Then remove and bake for another 15 or so, or until cooked through. 

Serve with Tabasco or green salsa. 

This makes a fine sandwich the next day. 



*Buttermilk can stay good in your refrigerator for truly months, if you shake it every now and then. It’s sort of already bad. But I was still embarrassed when Sarah Jane found a very very very old container in my fridge while visiting. </p></body></html>
