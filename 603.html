Double this recipe for a two layer cake</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2 TB cocoa
3/4 c sugar
3TB cornstarch
3 OZ best quality 70% chocolate -finely chopped
Pinch of salt

1 cup boiling H20

1- 1/2 TB butter
1 TSP vanilla

Mix cocoa, chopped chocolate, sugar, cornstarch & salt in a medium sized heavy bottomed saucepan.

Pour boiling H20 over ingredients in pan. Whisk until blended. Whisk continuously 
over Med. high-ish heat until it thickens and starts to bubble. It will look like chocolate pudding. Turn the heat down a bit and whisk for one more minute.

Remove from heat, add butter and vanilla. Whisk until blended. Cover with plastic wrap touching the frosting so a skin doesn't form, refrigerate for at least a half hour. Try not to eat it all before you frost the cake.
