tatoes, both from Trader Joes</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1/2 cup olive oil
Juice and grated zest of 2 lemons
4 cloves garlic, lightly bruised and peeled
8 fresh rosemary sprigs
Salt and coarsely ground black pepper, to taste
2 chickens (about 2&1/2 pounds each), rinsed well and patted dry
1&1/2 pounds small new red potatoes, scrubbed and halved 
1 cup imported green olives

l.  Combine the olive oil, lemon juice and zest, garlic, rosemary, salt
and pepper in a large bowl.  Coat the whole chickens well with the 
marinade and refrigerate covered overnight.
2.  Preheat oven to 400.
3.  Place chickens in a large roasting pan.  Put the rosemary sprigs and
garlic from the marinade in the chicken cavities.  Surround the chickens with
the potatoes and olives and drzzle the marinade over all.
4.  Roast the chickens, basting occasionally, until the juices run clear when
the thickest part of the thigh is pricked with a knife, about 1 hour( I use a thermomoter).  Let
rest 1/2 hour before carving.  Serves 4 to 6.</p></body></html>
