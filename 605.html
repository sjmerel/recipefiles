Masa harina is a fine cornmeal treated with lime; in Los Angeles, you can buy it in most large supermarkets; other parts of the world you might have to hunt around a bit!  The usual brand I see is called "Maseca".</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">For the dough:
2 cups masa harina
1 1/2 cups water (approximately)

For the filling:
Grated cheese (I use something mild like mozarella)
Canned black or pinto beans

For the curtido:
1/2 head green cabbage
1 carrot
oregano, salt, cider or white vinegar, chili to taste

For the frying:
vegetable oil

Grate the cabbage and carrot into a bowl.  Pour in boiling water to cover; leave for 5 minutes, then drain and squeeze out excess water.  Toss with about 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 cup vinegar (or to taste), a sprinkle of oregano, and a shake of chili sauce or chili flakes.

Mix the masa harina and water well in a bowl and let it sit for a few minutes to absorb.  It should be wet enough to work with but not so wet it's very sticky and messy.  Roll into a ball about the size of a golf ball, then stick your thumb in and make it into a little cup.  Put some beans and cheese in, then close it up and flatten into a pancake.  Don't worry if some of the filling sticks out a little bit.

Heat a large pan or skillet on the stove, and add some vegetable oil.  (I normally only add a thin layer, but my pupusas always taste a little too healthy, so probably better to use a heavy hand.)  Fry the pupusas on each side until they start getting a little browned.

Serve the pupusas with the curtido on the side, and plenty of hot sauce.</p></body></html>
