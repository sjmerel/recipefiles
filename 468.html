1 cup dried blueberries
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
Bottled poppy seed dressing to taste
1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts or sliced almonds

Whenever making this, try to put the heavy ingredients in the salad bowl first.  Then add the dressing to the bottom of the bowl and top with the greens and dry ingredients.  Cover with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator up to 8 hours ahead.  When it comes time to serve, simply toss the salad and serve.  It saves a lot of time in the kitchen and you are not as likely to forget and ingredient.</p></body></html>
