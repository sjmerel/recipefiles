It's even good for those who claim to hate kale; the heat of the oven seems to bring out the brassica-ness of the kale, making it almost broccoli-like, nutty and good.  (Okay, maybe the Parm has something to do with that too.)
You have no idea how hard I had to restrain myself from spelling "crispy" with a "k" in the title of this recipe.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">A bunch of kale
Olive oil
Parmesan cheese, grated

Preheat your oven to 375F.  Tear the kale into bite-sized pieces and wash and dry it in a salad spinner, but don't worry if the leaves are still a little damp -- somehow it gets crispy anyway.  

Spread these pieces in a single layer on a baking sheet.  Kyo drizzled hers with olive oil and then tossed them gently, but I got one of those fancy refillable oil sprayer bottles for Christmas last year and this is a great place to use it: spray all the leaves with a fine mist of olive oil until they are lightly coated.  Or do the same with the drizzling-tossing method.  

Then sprinkle the grated Parm evenly over the kale.  It should be a light dusting, not a heavy snowfall. 

Bake in oven 10 minutes, or until kale is shriveled and crispy-looking, but still green.  It shouldn't take much longer than 10 minutes, so do keep an eye on it; once I left it too long and it was a brownish mess, very disappointing.

Serve as a side dish; it's especially nice with soup.</p></body></html>
