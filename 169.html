I always quadruple this recipe. It will be gone in a flash if you bring it to a party...If it ever makes it to the party. Zoe can attest to the addictive quality of this recipe. The egg adds a richness and complexity to this and no one can ever guess that there is an egg in there. It's even good for you!
This is also great with fresh diced ripe tomatoes alongside soft scrambled eggs. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 ripe Haas avocado - very small dice
1 hard cooked egg - very small dice
1/2 C. cilantro - minced or very fine chiffonade
2 TB scallion - fine dice
2 TB red onion - fine dice
2 TB red pepper  - fine dice
2 TB green pepper  - fine dice
Red or white wine and/or cider vinegar to taste. Start with one TB and go from there.
Tabasco (Other hot sauces work well too) to taste
S&P to taste

Mix avocado, cilantro, eggs, scallions, onion and peppers in a bowl, add vinegar, tabasco and S&P. 
This can handle more salt than you think.

Serve with your favorite corn chips or just eat it with a spoon. </p></body></html>
