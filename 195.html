I know it's very similar to one Francine and Rebecca posted, but I think it's a nice variation.  It's quite a dry pasta dish, so don't worry when it looks like there isn't nearly enough sauce to coat all the noodles -- the flavour is so assertive that it manages to permeate the whole thing with salty, fishy goodness.  And while it's perfectly fine without the fresh herbs at the end, please don't assume that the lemon is for decorative purposes only; it really makes it zing.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2 Tblsp butter
1 large garlic clove, minced
Hot pepper flakes to taste
1 can anchovies
1 can of tuna in oil (NOT water; I use Pastene)
Freshly ground black pepper
1 Tblsp capers
1 bunch arugula (rocket) leaves, washed and cut into strips
Fresh chives and/or basil, snipped
Freshly grated Parmesan cheese
Lemon  wedges
1 lb spaghettini

Melt the butter in a wide saucepan and stir in the garlic, hot pepper, and anchovies.

Cook briefly at medium heat until the anchovies fall apart and the garlic turns slightly golden.

Add the tuna with its oil (see why it was so important?) and break it up into small pieces. Mill in plenty of pepper, add the capers, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring often.

Meanwhile, cook spaghettini al dente.

Add the drained cooked pasta to the sauce in the pan (or vice versa, I never make it in a pan large enough).  Top with the arugula and toss to coat.  As I said, it will remain quite dry.

Sprinkle with chives and/or basil to taste.  Serve with generous gratings of fresh Parm and the lemon wedges.</p></body></html>
