Who knew a mushroom could taste so rich?  Maybe it has something to do with all the butter.  

Based on a recipe from Jamie Oliver.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">2 large portobello mushrooms
2 hamburger buns (whole wheat is nicest)
2 Tbs butter
2 Tbs extra virgin olive oil
1 tsp salt, or to taste
pepper
a fat clove of garlic (or two)
fresh herbs (thyme or rosemary)
mustard
arugula

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Take the stem off the mushrooms; clean them and throughly dry them.  Press the garlic into a small bowl and mash it up with the butter, olive oil, herbs, and salt and pepper until it makes a very tasty pungent paste. Spray the mushroom caps lightly with olive oil and put them upside-down on a baking sheet.  (It's best to use a sheet that has a rim around it, to catch the juices from the mushrooms.)  Spread the butter mixture on top of each mushroom.  Cook until the mushrooms go nice and floppy and oozy, probably about 20 minutes.  Put each mushroom on a bun with a bit of mustard and arugula and eat.</p></body></html>
