They're so delicious and Nora's favourite breakfast (with bacon and makle syrup - as she calls it). The revelation (for me anyway) is that you can make them with yoghurt, so you don't absolutely have to plan in advance and get hold of buttermilk.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Ingredients:

2 Cups White Flour

1 Cup Buttermilk (or 1/2 Cup Plain Yoghurt + 1/2 Cup Milk)

3 Eggs

1 tsp Salt

2 tsp Sugar

2 tsp Baking Powder

2 Cups Milk (or the right amount for desired consistency)

2 Cups of Blueberries

Mix all the ingredients together - except the blueberries. Leave for at least 15 minutes - longer if possible. 

Makes really nice thick pancakes dripping with purple juice as the blueberries explode. Num num num.</p></body></html>
