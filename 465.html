They have a ganache "topping" which isn't really a topping at all , it  just bakes into the brownies making them super rich and fudgy.
Double dark Ghiradelli chips work well or  add Hershey's mint chips to the "topping"  if you want  chocolate mint brownies.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Pre-heat oven to 350

Brownies:
½ c butter
12 oz chocolate chips
2 c sugar
3 eggs

"Topping"
¾ c whipping cream 
6 oz chocolate chips
½ c sugar
3 eggs

For topping, melt chocolate chips (6 oz) and cream together in microwave for 60 seconds.  Beat eggs and sugar together.  Add chocolate mixture.  Add vanilla.  (Mixture will be very runny.)  Pour over brownie batter.
