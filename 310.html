We were recently visiting our friends Tamar and Jason in Boston and Jason made this for dinner the first night we were there. We had already made plans to meet Francine for dinner at Redbones that night and arrived back at Tamar and Jason's place, full of pulled pork, to see and smell this delicious pizza. I was too full to try any but it looked so good that I vowed to make it soon, and it indeed tasted as good as it looked and smelled. I guess it doesn't sound very seasonal, but the farmer's market last week here in Chicago was full of kale (which was what we used instead of turnip greens), so there you go. Incidentally, I am very into this Italian sweet-salty way with greens and my default way of making kale now (which I learned from Ellen) is another variation on this theme. First you wilt some washed and roughly chopped kale in a pan. Set aside. Saute garlic in lots of olive oil, then throw in lots of raisins and pine nuts, then return the kale to the pan and finish with lots of lemon and salt and pepper. Delicious. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">
Cooking spray or olive oil
1 cup sliced red onion (about 1 medium)
3 tablespoons raisins
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 canned anchovy fillets, minced (we used more, maybe half a can)
3 cups loosely packed baby spinach (about 3 ounces)
3 cups chopped turnip greens (about 5 ounces)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
3/4 cup (3 ounces) shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup (2 ounces) grated Asiago cheese

pizza dough (we use Trader Joe's pizza dough)

Preparation
Preheat oven to 400°.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Coat pan with cooking spray (or olive oil). Add red onion, and cook for 10 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add 3 tablespoons raisins, garlic, and anchovies; cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add spinach and greens; cover and cook for 4 minutes or until spinach and greens wilt. Uncover and cook for 3 minutes or until liquid evaporates. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper. Cool slightly. 

In the meantime stretch and flatten out your pizza dough and place on a cornmeal dusted cookie sheet or pizza stone and bake until fairly crisp.

Sprinkle crust evenly with mozzarella; top evenly with spinach mixture. Sprinkle Asiago evenly over spinach mixture. Bake at 400° for 12 minutes or until cheese melts and begins to brown. Cut pizza into wedges.
