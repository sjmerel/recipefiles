If your sweet tooth runs to the minimalist, as mine does, you will like this, as it is simple, sophisticated and not too sweet.   It is rather reminiscent of a brownie, only more adult.  

From Claudia Roden's Book of Jewish Food</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">250 g (9 oz) dark, bittersweet chocolate
6 eggs, separated
75 g (3 oz) sugar

Beat egg yolks with sugar until pale
Add ground almonds, chocolate and one egg white and mix very well
In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff
