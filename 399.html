1 medium size can of tomato sauce
1 can of tomato soup
1 small can of tomato paste
1 lb of lean ground beef
2 cloves garlic crushed
1 large onion chopped fine
olive oil
Red wine
Spices:
salt
pepper
sugar
bay leaf
basil
oregano
red pepper flakes
chili powder
celery salt

Cook onions in about 2 tbs of olive oil and remove from pan. Add ground beef and cook until red is gone. Cook on high heat so the meat doesn't start to boil. Add the garlic and cooked onions and cook for a few more minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients and let it simmer for about 30 minutes. As for the red wine, I add about 2 tbs to the sauce, drink some while I make the sauce, and serve the rest with the spagetti. Serve with garlic bread. The sauce is even better the next day!</p></body></html>
