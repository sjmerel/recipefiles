Good for upcoming cold weather - and flexible: you can substitue most any vegetable for the corn (potatoes, sauteed zucchini, greens)</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 pound (6 medium-large) fresh poblano chilis
1 T. olive oil
1 large white onion, slice 1/4 inch thick
3 garlic cloves
1/2 t. Mexican oregano
1/4 t .dried thyme

6 c. sliced chard or spinach leaves
4 1/2 c. broth, chicken or vegetable
1/2 c. cream, thick cream or creme fraiche
1/2 c. masa harina
salt to taste
Kernels cut from 5-6 ears fresh corn

Roast poblanos under flame of broiler until blackened on all sides. Place in a covered bowl to let cool before peeling and removing seeds and stems. Cut into strips.

Meanwhile, heat oil in a heavy 4 qt. pot over medium-high heat.  Saute onions til nicely browned but still crunchy, then add garlic and herbs. After a minute, add chiles. Heat through.

Add spinach or chard leaves and 1 cup of the broth. Cover and simmer over medium heat until greens are cooked but still vibrant green, about 4 min. Remove from heat and puree in batches in food processor or blender. Return to the pot. You can strain through a mesh strainer if you want a finer texture, but I don't find it worth the bother. Whisk in the masa harina, and the soup should thicken immediately. Add corn kernels and heat for about a minute or two, just to cook corn slightly. Add cream and check for salt. Serve immediately.
