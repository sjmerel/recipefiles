In fact it's a recipe from G2 (Guardian supplement)  by Allegra McEvedy which appeared on 28.03.07.  It's scrummy - for those who like nuts.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">
200g unsalted butter
250g golden granulated sugar
250g ground cashews, raw and unsalted
3 eggs
Zest and juice of 2 oranges
110g semolina, fine
1 level teaspoon baking powder
Pinch of salt
2 tablespoons orange blossom water (or I substituted orange juice)
15g rosemary, washed and picked into sprigs
2 tablespoons caster sugar

Preheat oven to 160C/300F/gas mark 3.  Cream butter and sugar together with a mixer until light and pale.  Mix in ground cashews.  Add the eggs one by one, waiting till each is fully incorporated before adding the next.  Stir in orange zest and juice, followed by semolina, baking powder and salt.

Lightly grease a 12in springform cake tin with butter, then dust with flour and tip out the excess.  Spoon the mix into the tin and bake for around 90 minutes.

Allow to cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Meanwhile put the rosemary sprigs in a small pan with the sugar and five tablespoons of water.  Cook over a low heat for 5 - 10 minutes until the rosemary has crystallised and the sugar has turned into a clear syrup.

Once the cake has cooled a little, sprinkle on the orange blossom water and then pour the rosemary syrup on top.  Now loosen around the edges with a knife before lifting the cake out.  Keep it covered and at room temperature and it lasts for days.
