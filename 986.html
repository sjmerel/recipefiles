Pastry
1 pkg cream cheese, softened
1 cup butter, softened
2 tbsp granulated sugar
2 cups all purpose flour


Filling
1 cup toasted slivered almonds
1/2 cup raisins
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
3/4 cup apricot jam (needs to be smooth enough for spreading)
Topping
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tsp granulated sugar (or coarse, if you have it)
Directions

To make pastry:
Beat cream cheese with butter until fluffy.  Beat in sugar.  
Using wooden spoon, gradually stir flour mixture into cheese mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time
With lightly floured hands, form dough into ball.  Cut into quarters and shape each into rounds.  Chill for at least 3 hours or up to 24 hours.
Let dough stand for at least 15 minutes before rolling out.
Line baking sheets with parchment paper.  Set aside
To make filling:
Combine almonds, raisins, brown and white sugar, and cinnamon.  Divide evenly among four small bowls.  Set aside.

To prepare rugelach:
Preheat oven to 350F
On lightly floured surface, roll out each portion of dough into circle about 12 inches round and 1/4 inch thick.
Spread 3 tbsp of jam over each circle
Sprinkle each circle with one-quarter of the almond mixture (one bowl per circle)
Using sharp knife, cut each circle into 4 pie-shaped wedges. 
Then cut each wedge into 3 smaller wedges
Starting at wide edge of each wedge, roll up to form crescent.
Place on prepared pans
Brush each crescent with beaten egg; sprinkle with sugar
Bake about 30 minutes or until slightly puffed and cool to the touch
Let cool on racks</p></body></html>
