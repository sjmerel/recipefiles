It’s great with asparagus and wild rice. I will say that quality of the olives is quite important here. I made it recently with not-so-great olives that had a chemical taste, which I discovered when eating the requisite first handful out of the jar. Sad. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">4 salmon pieces (with skin on one side) 
cumin
salt and pepper
olive oil or cooking spray to grease baking dish or pan

*relish: 
1 cup (or as much as you want, for olive lovers) kalamata olives, 
pitted and roughly chopped or mashed with fingers
2-3 tomatoes, diced
fresh basil (optional)



Preheat oven to 450 F. and make sure there’s a rack in the middle. 

Rinse the salmon pieces and pat dry.  Salt and pepper them all over, skin and flesh sides. Then generously rub cumin all over the exposed flesh.

Place the salmon pieces skin side up on a greased glass dish or a cookie sheet (or line either with greased tinfoil for easy cleanup.) Roast for 10 minutes or until cooked through, depending on the thickness of the fish---it’s good to keep checking; otherwise the fish can dry out. Sometimes I do it for 8 and turn the oven off; it will keep cooking. 

While the fish is cooking, toss the olives and tomatoes in a pan over medium heat and warm them up a bit—just a few minutes. Add ripped-in-half-lengthwise basil leaves here if you want---I usually don’t bother. 

Remove skin from salmon, put on plates and artfully spoon the tomato-olive mixture over the fish. 

*I like to make extra so there’s enough to pass.
