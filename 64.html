A Red Onion 
Garlic Cloves 
Basil Leaves 
Dried Chilli Flakes 
Olive Oil 

Fresh pasta - preferably spaghetti 


Heat your oven to 200c, 400F 

Pour a little olive oil into a ceramic dish and sprinkle a few flakes of dried chilli in the oil - then put the dish into the oven. 

Chop the red onion, halve the cherry tomatoes, tear up the basil leaves, peel half the garlic cloves and leave the other half unpeeled. Then throw all the above ingredients into the dish of oil when it's hot, saving some of the basil for later. 

Leave in the oven for about 20 minutes. When everything's melting together, and the dish is full of a deliciously intense mixture of the tomatoes, the softened garlic, and onion, flavoured with the chilli and the basil - cook the fresh pasta. 

When the pasta's drained, stir it into the melted tomato - so that you make sure you get every last drop of sauce into the spaghetti. 

Serve with plenty of grated parmesan and the remaining basil leaves. 

(This is really just an excuse to eat the fantastically melting peeled garlic gloves, or suck the delicious garlic from the unpeeled cloves once it's been marinated in the mouth-watering hot tomato juice. Man, it's delicious.)
