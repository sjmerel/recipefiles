olive oil
salt
pepper

Preheat oven to 200 degrees. 

Salt and pepper the birds, being especially generous with the salt. Put them in a hot frying pan with the olive oil and brown on all sides. Put into the oven and roast for 20 minutes.

Eat with your fingers (although they go very well with mashed potato and cabbage, for which you'll probably want cutlery).

Numbers-wise, you only need 2 each - but some will manage three.</p></body></html>
