Basil - a handful, torn
Garlic - 1 clove, minced or crushed and finely chopped
Rocket / Arugula - a big handful
Buffalo Mozzarella - 1 ball, thickly sliced
Tomatoes - roughly chopped or thickly sliced
Black Pepper - lots
Olive Oil

Pizza dough
Polenta/Cornmeal


Preheat oven to Gas mark 7 - 450Â°.

Roll or stretch the pizza dough onto a baking tray or pizza stone that has been sprinkled with polenta.

Spread the Tomato sauce lightly but evenly on the base and sprinkle with plenty of torn Basil and the Garlic.

Bake until the base is brown and crisp - usually about 15 minutes. 

Take the pizza out of the oven and, while it's still on the stone or the tray, cover with the Rocket and add the thick slices of Mozzarella and the Tomatoes. Ideally, as you bite into it, the Mozzarella should have just softened from the heat of the pizza while still being cool and fresh.

Sprinkle with coarse ground Black Pepper and a drizzle of Olive Oil.
