Quick, easy and the best molten chocolate cake I've ever eaten.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 stick unsalted butter
6oz. best quality bittersweet chocolate
2 eggs
2 yolks
1/4 c. sugar
pinch salt
2 Tb.  AP flour


Preheat oven to 450

Butter and flour four 6oz. ramekins

Melt butter and chocolate over a water bath

Beat eggs, yolks, sugar and salt until thick and pale

Stir butter and chocolate with a spatula until smooth.

Quickly fold chocolate mixture into the eggs along with the flour

Pour into ramekins and bake for 10 -12 minutes or until the edges are firm but the center is soft.
 Cool cakes for one minute, then invert and unmold.

The center should be molten when you cut into it. If not, you cooked it too long. It will still taste good, but not as good as when it's molten, try a shorter baking time next time around

Dust with powdered sugar and serve cakes  by thenselves
or with...
mint creme anglaise
raspberry coulis
espresso creme anglaise
whipped cream
ginger whipped cream
home made or best quality vanilla, malted vanilla, caramel or espresso ice cream.
The possibilities are endless</p></body></html>
