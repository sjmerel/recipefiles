This is a traditional Southern dish served on New Year's Day to bring good luck in the coming year. It's usually accompanied by a dish of greens, meant to ensure a wealthy year. This recipe doesn't soak the black-eyed peas but we have. Maybe if you eat it throughout the year, you can have good luck whenever!</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Seasoning Mix:
