You can adjust the sweetness to your taste, of course, and use whatever nuts are handy.

</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">4 cups rolled oats
a handful of raw pumpkin seeds
a handful of raw, shelled sunflower seeds
a handful of flax seeds
a handful of almonds
1/4 cup oil (I often use half olive oil)
1/4 to 1/2 cup molasses (depending on how molasses-y you like it)
pinch of cinammon
a few drops of vanilla
1 Tbsp brown sugar
1/4 tsp salt

Combine oats and nuts in a deep baking tray.  Combine all the other ingredients in a bowl; heat a few seconds in the microwave to loosen it up.  Pour this goo into the baking tray and stir the whole thing well with your hands until the oats are well-coated.  (Don't be shy.)  Put the pan in a 400 degree oven.  Watch it carefully so it doesn't burn; give it a stir every few minutes as the stuff on the top starts to go brown.  When it's starting to get a toasty color, take it out.  (The pumpkin seeds are a good indicator; they'll start to turn from green to brown and will start to make crackling sounds.)  Don't worry if it still feels soft; it will get crispier as it cools.  Let it cool and store in tupperware.
