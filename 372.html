From the Islington Cookbook</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">4 oz brown sugar
4 oz butter (half butter and half canola oil also works)
4 oz oats
4 oz flour
2 Tbsp golden syrup (or honey or maple syrup)
optional: 1/2 tsp vanilla
optional: pinch of salt

Melt butter in a bowl in the microwave; add brown sugar and mix.  Add everything else.  Spread on a baking tray and bake at 375 F for 10-20 minutes, until lightly browned.  It will firm up as it cools.  Try not to eat it all at once.</p></body></html>
