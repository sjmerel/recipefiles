This is my first recipe on this fine website.....and it's a blinder. It's got a good lot of vodka in it, so if you have friends that don't drink, don't invite them round anymore because they're weird.

600g of tinned tomatoes
100ml of double cream
3 cloves of finely chopped garlic
1 teaspoon of chilli flakes
2 tablespoons of olive oil
150ml of vodka
50g grated parmigianno reggiano
Pinch of salt and pepper

320g spaghetti/tagliatelle

Put the olive oil into an expensive saucepan. Heat up and add the chopped garlic and chilli flakes. Before the garlic turns gold, add the tomatoes and stir. Let the tomato mixture simmer for 20 minutes. Meanwhile heat the cream in a seperate saucepan (this will avoid "splitting" the cream), until boiling point, and cook your pasta.

Now add the vodka to your sauce (unfortunately this is the point at which the alcohol burns off, so make sure you open some wine while you're cooking). If you have the tools, blitz the sauce in the pan with a blender. 

Put your cooked pasta into your vodka sauce and add the boiling cream and parmesan, stirring until it melts in. Salt and pepper to taste.

Serve with a bit of extra parmesan on top.

Let the good times roll.</p></body></html>
