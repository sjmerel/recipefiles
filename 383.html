2 heads brocolli [4cups]
1/4 cup olive oil
4 Tbs butter
3 cloves garlic
5 anchovy filets
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan

Cut brocolli into bite size pieces and set aside. Cook pasta as directed on the box and after 5 minutes of boiling, add the brocolli to the pasta and cook another 4 minutes. Drain and save about a cup of pasta water. In a saucepan, add the olive oil, butter, garlic and anchovies. Crush the anchovies with a fork or wooden spoon. Add the salt, pepper, and pepper flakes. Add to the pasta and brocolli and gently stir. Add parmesan cheese and stir adding some of the pasta water to create a cheesy sauce. This is at your discretion. I add about a half cup and it makes it nice and creamy. Add more grated cheese to the top. It's DE-licious!</p></body></html>
