We'll see which of us bursts out of our corsets first). </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Ham
Asparagus
Marscapone
Lemon zest
Basil
Passata/light tomato sauce
Black olives
Parmesan
Black Pepper

Pizza Dough
Polenta/Cornmeal. 

Sprinkle preheated pizza stone with polenta, then add your rolled dough. 
Lightly spread with tomato sauce, sprinkle with basil. 
Put on some torn ham, then arrange the asparagus spears, tips meeting in the centre (though Henry made a variation on this earlier this week that looked like a primitive orienteering sign and it tasted none the worse). Sprinkle on the olives. 
Blob on some tiny spoonfuls of marscapone, and peel a little lemon zest onto each of these. 
Rain down a little parmesan. 

Bake for about 15 mins at gas mark 7/450/220 - til the edges of the base are turning up.
