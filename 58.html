Here's what i do: 

Take: 

However much risotto you have left 
A ball of mozzarella, cut into small cubes, or some marscapone, or both 
Breadcrumbs - quite finely chopped 
A little olive oil 

Plus, for a sauce: 

A tin of tomatoes 
Some crushed dried chillis 
A little more olive oil 


To make the Suppli scoop a handful of risotto out of the bowl and pat it flat in the palm of your hand. Put a cube of mozzarella, or a teaspoon of marscapone, in the middle of the flattened risotto, then fold the sticky rice around the cheese until it's completely incased. Roll the 'Suppli' that you've just made into a ball and set aside. 

When you've turned all the risotto into little balls spread the breadcrumbs out on a plate and roll the Suppli in the breadcrumbs until they're completely coated. 

Then shallow fry them in a frying pan until the breadcrumbs are beautifully golden and the mozzarella in the middle is melted enough to stretch out like string when you cut them in half. 

I like to serve them hot, in quite a spicy tomato sauce, with parmesan on top. </p></body></html>
