While preparing the filling this year, I remembered a long-held conviction of mine: "a little lemon makes (almost) everything taste better!".  So I added some, along with some fresh ginger, and a tablespoon of flour, in case the lemon made the filling too runny.  And you know, I thought it was pretty good.  It's also (due to Sarah's and Steve's direction) less sweet, so it's slightly less calorific, which is always a nice side benefit.  We baked it in a French tart pan, which allowed for more dainty servings, and I highly recommend adopting this further modification.
