1 cup self-rising floour, plus extra for work surface

Preheat over to 425degrees. Blend sour cream and flour in a mixing bowl with a fork until it comes together but is still a little rough-looking. Turn dough out onto a well-floured work surface and let stand for a couple of minutes.

Pat or roll dough out with well-floured hands or rolling pin to 3/4 inch thickness. Using a floured 2 - 3" biscuit cutter, cut out 12 - 14 rounds, reworking dough as little as posible.

Place biscuits on cookie sheet that has been greased or sprayed with nonstick spray. Bake in the top third of the oven for 12 - 15 minutes, or util biscuits are light brown on top. Serve warm. Makes 12 - 14 biscuits.
