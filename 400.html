Not quite as thick as stew and thicker than soup. Great with fresh baked bread. One of my fondest memories of my mom and Aunt Jeanelle. They made a mean chicken stew. </p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1 whole chicken
4 potatoes
2 stalks of celery
1 large onion quartered
Dumplings - [You can find them in the frozen section at the grocery store]
salt 
pepper
Herbes de Provence

Clean and rinse the chicken. Put in a large pot and add the celery and one potato, [cleaned with the skin on], and the onion. Add salt, pepper and Herbes de Provence. Cook until chicken is done and falls apart. Remove the chicken, let cool and de-bone, cutting in bite size pieces. Take the potato, celery, onion and put in a blender with a bit of the broth. Pulse until everything disolves, just a few seconds. This will create a thickening agent for the stew and it will carry all the flavors of onions, celery and herbs. Put back in the pot. Peel the remaining potatoes and cut in bite size pieces, add to the broth and bring back to a boil. When the broth starts to boil, take your dumplings out of the freezer and break off in pieces adding them to the boiling broth. Cook until potatoes and dumplings are done. Add the cut up chicken back into the pot and cook together a few more minutes. Taste for saltiness. Great anytime! a family favorite.</p></body></html>
