1 cup (7 ounces) sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 cups water, preferably bottled or filtered
2 tablespoons vodka (optional, makes fluffier ice)

1. Combine ingredients in medium (at least 3 qt) nonreactive bowl, whisking occasionally to dissolve sugar.
2. Pour mixture into two ice cube trays and freeze until thoroughly frozen, at least 2 1/2 hours.
3. Here they give all these complex instructions about freezing the food processor blade and working quickly, blah blah blah.  The gist is that you dump it into a Cuisinart or a blender and pulse it until it's nice and creamy, then eat it.

If you have an ice cream maker, of course that will work too.</p></body></html>
