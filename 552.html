She called it Daddy's Chicken because it was her father's favorite recipe.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">1/2 cup ketchup
1/3 cup vinegar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 clove ground or powdered garlic
1 tbsp mustard
1 tbsp oil
chicken

Mix everything but the chicken in a casserole dish.  Remove the skin from the chicken.  If the pieces of chicken are large then put deep cuts in it.  Put the chicken into the sauce.  If you have cuts, make sure to open the cuts and mix the sauce in.

Cook at 375 for 30-45 minutes.  Serve with rice.

I sometimes prepare the casserole dish ahead of time and let it marinade in the fridge.  Then I increase the cooking time to be sure it cooks properly.</p></body></html>
