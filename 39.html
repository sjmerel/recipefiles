A large bunch of fresh broccoli, about 1 pound
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
6 flat anchovy fillets, chopped very fine
Chopped hot red chili peppers, to taste
1 1/2 pounds pasta
2 tablespoons freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese
1/4 cup freshly grated romano cheese

Recommended pasta: A chewy, handmade pasta from Apulia known as orecchiette- it looks like miniature saucers-is the natural match for this earthy broccoli sauce. Orecchiette can be made at home, but it is also available in shops that specialize in imported Italian products. An excellent alternative to orecchiette is fusilli or conchiglie.

1. Detach the broccoli florets from the stalks, but do not discard the stalks. Pare the stalks, wash the stalks and florets, and cook them in salted, boiling water until just tender when prodded with a fork.
2. Drain the broccoli, break up the florets into smaller pieces, and cut the stalks into large dice. Set aside.
3. Put water in a saucepan, and bring it to a lively simmer.
4. Put the oil in a sauté pan and turn on the heat to low. When the oil begins to warm up, place the pan over the saucepan of simmering water, double-boiler fashion, and add the chopped anchovies. Cook, stirring and mashing the anchovies with the back of a wooden spoon to dissolve them as much as possible into a paste.
Ahead-of-time note: The sauce may be prepared a few hours in advance up to this point, but do not refrigerate the cooked broccoli.
5. Return the sauté pan to the burner over medium heat. If you were making the first part of the sauce in advance, reheat the anchovies gently, stirring with a wooden spoon. Add the broccoli florets, the diced stalks, and the hot chili pepper. Cook the broccoli for 4 to 5 minutes, turning it from time to time to coat it well.
6. Toss the entire contents of the pan with cooked drained pasta. Add both grated cheeses, and toss thoroughly once again. Serve immediately. </p></body></html>
