I suspect that the addition of avocados makes it "Modern Spanish".  In any case, they also add a deliciously creamy counterpart to the tang of the dish.</p><p>recipe:</p><p class="recipe">Ingredients:

   1 tbsp sherry or white wine vinegar
   2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
   Salt and pepper
   3 oranges (medium to large)
   1 1/2 avocados
   15-20 black olives
   5-6 thin slices red onion
    

Preparation:

Make a vinaigrette: mix salt and pepper with vinegar, then add olive oil.

Peel the oranges carefully and remove any extra white pulp from the outside. Cut into slices approximately 1/4-inch thick and arrange on individual plates or on a large platter.

Slice the red onion into very thin rings and then cut in half. Peel and carefully slice the avocados.

Arrange the avocado slices on the orange slices. Place the red onion slices and olives on top.

Lightly sprinkle vinegar on platter or individual plates. Drizzle the extra virgin olive oil over the top of each.</p></body></html>
