Salad Mix:     16oz Cole Slaw Mix, I use Dole's
                    2 Pkg Ramen Beef Noodles (uncooked)
                    6-7 Green Onions  ( at least 2 inches of green leaf part also) Chopped
                    1 Cup toasted slivered or sliced Almonds
                    1 Cup Sunflower Kernels (salted or unsalted, I use salted)
                    Mix well above ingredients together
                    Refrigerate and add Salad Dressing Mix when ready or Add Salad Dressing and Refrigerate until ready to serve.  I mix at least two hours ahead.  I like the noodles to have time to absorb the Salad Dressing
 
Salad Dressing Mix:
                    1 Cup Canola Oil
                    1/2 Cup Gran. sugar
                    1/3 Cup Cider Vinegar
                    2 pkg flavoring Mix from Beef Ramen Noodles
                    Blend well above ingredients until smooth ( all sugar dissolved)
                    Pour Dressing over Salad Mix & Stir in well. Serve immediately or refrigerate 2-3 hours first.
